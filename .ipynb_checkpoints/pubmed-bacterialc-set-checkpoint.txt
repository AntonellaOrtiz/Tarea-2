AB  - Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a natural polymer produced by the acetic acid producing 
      bacterium and has gathered much interest over the last decade for its biomedical and 
      biotechnological applications. Unlike the plant derived cellulose nanofibres, which 
      require pretreatment to deconstruct the recalcitrant lignocellulosic network, BC are 
      100% pure, and are extruded by cells as nanofibrils. Moreover, these nanofibrils can 
      be converted to macrofibers that possess excellent material properties, surpassing 
      even the strength of steel, and can be used as substitutes for fossil fuel derived 
      synthetic fibers. The focus of the review is to present the fundamental long-term 
      research on the influence of environmental factors on the organism's BC production 
      capabilities, the production methods that are available for scaling up/scaled-up 
      processes, and its use as a bulk commodity or for biomedical applications.

AB  - Bacterial cellulose produced by few but specific microbial genera is an extremely 
      pure natural exopolysaccharide. Besides providing adhesive properties and a 
      competitive advantage to the cellulose over-producer, bacterial cellulose confers UV 
      protection, ensures maintenance of an aerobic environment, retains moisture, 
      protects against heavy metal stress, etc. This unique nanostructured matrix is being 
      widely explored for various medical and nonmedical applications. It can be produced 
      in various shapes and forms because of which it finds varied uses in biomedicine. 
      The attributes of bacterial cellulose such as biocompatibility, haemocompatibility, 
      mechanical strength, microporosity and biodegradability with its unique surface 
      chemistry make it ideally suited for a plethora of biomedical applications. This 
      review highlights these qualities of bacterial cellulose in detail with emphasis on 
      reports that prove its utility in biomedicine. It also gives an in-depth account of 
      various biomedical applications ranging from implants and scaffolds for tissue 
      engineering, carriers for drug delivery, wound-dressing materials, etc. that are 
      reported until date. Besides, perspectives on limitations of commercialisation of 
      bacterial cellulose have been presented. This review is also an update on the 
      variety of low-cost substrates used for production of bacterial cellulose and its 
      nonmedical applications and includes patents and commercial products based on 
      bacterial cellulose.

AB  - In practical applications, the full biodegradability of all-biomass-based bacterial 
      cellulose (BC) composites enhances their environmentally friendliness but results in 
      the poor durability especially at humid conditions. This work prepared BC/lignin 
      nanoparticles (LNPs) composite films with retarded biodegradability, which could 
      broaden their application area. Three LNPs were fabricated using technical lignins 
      extracted by deep eutectic solvent (DES), ethanol organosolv, soda/anthraquinone 
      from poplar. LNPs involvement during BC fermentation showed limited influence on its 
      productivity but significantly retarded the biodegradation of composite films. The 
      potential inhibition mechanism was physical barrier and non-productive binding of 
      LNPs. The BC/Soda LNPs showed much higher retarded degradation property (~58 wt% 
      degradation) compared to BC/Organosolv LNPs and BC/DES LNPs (~85 wt% and ~ 97 wt% 
      degradation respectively) at high enzyme loadings of 5 mg g(-1) BCE. While at low 
      enzyme loadings of 1 mg g(-1) BCE, all these three composite films showed comparable 
      retarded degradation property of ~60 wt%.

AB  - Hydrothermal degradation was used to pretreat terylene with an aim of noticeably 
      improving the yield of fermentable monomers: terephthalic acid (TPA), mono (2- 
      hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), bis-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET), and 
      ethylene glycol (EG). After 0.5 h of reaction time at 180 °C, hydrothermal 
      degradation with ammonia led to almost complete conversion of the terylene to TPA, 
      MHET, BHET and EG, which were then transformed by Taonella mepensis WT-6 to 
      bacterial cellulose (BC). Furthermore, the optimum fermentation conditions with the 
      maximum BC yield were 5.0 g/L yeast extract, 30.0 °C, pH 9.0, 8.0% inoculum, and 
      hydrolysate TOC (5.02 g/L). Additionally, mechanical and thermal analysis revealed 
      that the properties of BC produced from TAH medium were similar to those of BC 
      produced with HS medium. Considering the substantial amount of global terylene waste 
      being produced, this study provides an alternative solution for the biosynthesis of 
      BC.

AB  - The utilization of fermentation media derived from waste and by-product streams from 
      biodiesel and confectionery industries could lead to highly efficient production of 
      bacterial cellulose. Batch fermentations with the bacterial strain Komagataeibacter 
      sucrofermentans DSM (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen) 15973 were initially 
      carried out in synthetic media using commercial sugars and crude glycerol. The 
      highest bacterial cellulose concentration was achieved when crude glycerol (3.2 g/L) 
      and commercial sucrose (4.9 g/L) were used. The combination of crude glycerol and 
      sunflower meal hydrolysates as the sole fermentation media resulted in bacterial 
      cellulose production of 13.3 g/L. Similar results (13 g/L) were obtained when 
      flour-rich hydrolysates produced from confectionery industry waste streams were 
      used. The properties of bacterial celluloses developed when different fermentation 
      media were used showed water holding capacities of 102-138 g · water/g · dry 
      bacterial cellulose, viscosities of 4.7-9.3 dL/g, degree of polymerization of 
      1889.1-2672.8, stress at break of 72.3-139.5 MPa and Young's modulus of 0.97-1.64 
      GPa. This study demonstrated that by-product streams from the biodiesel industry and 
      waste streams from confectionery industries could be used as the sole sources of 
      nutrients for the production of bacterial cellulose with similar properties as those 
      produced with commercial sources of nutrients.

AB  - In order to clarify dynamic change of microbial community composition and to 
      identify key functional bacteria in the cellulose degradation consortium, we studied 
      several aspects of the biodegradation of filter papers and rice straws by the 
      microbial consortium, the change of substrate degradation, microbial biomass and pH 
      of fermentation broth. We extracted total DNA of the microbial consortium in 
      different degradation stages for high-throughput sequencing of amplicons of 
      bacterial 16 S rRNA genes. Based on the decomposition characteristics test, we 
      defined the 12th, 72nd and 168th hours after inoculation as the initial stage, peak 
      stage and end stage of degradation, respectively. The microbial consortium was 
      mainly composed of 1 phylum, 2 classes, 2 orders, 7 families and 11 genera. With 
      cellulose degradation, bacteria in the consortium showed different growth trends. 
      The relative abundance of Brevibacillus and Caloramator decreased gradually. The 
      relative abundance of Clostridium, Bacillus, Geobacillus and Cohnella increased 
      gradually. The relative abundance of Ureibacillus, Tissierella, Epulopiscium was the 
      highest in peak stage. The relative abundance of Paenibacillus and Ruminococcus did 
      not change obviously in each stage. Above-mentioned 11 main genera all belonged to 
      Firmicutes, which are thermophilic, broad pH adaptable and cellulose or 
      hemicellulose degradable. During cellulose degradation by the microbial consortium, 
      aerobic bacteria were dominant functional bacteria in the initial stage. However, 
      the relative abundance of anaerobic bacteria increased gradually in middle and end 
      stage, and replaced aerobic bacteria to become main bacteria to degrade cellulose.

TI  - Microfluidics for bacterial chemotaxis.
PG  - 604-29
LID - 10.1039/c0ib00049c [doi]
AB  - Microfluidics is revolutionizing the way we study the motile behavior of cells, by 
      enabling observations at high spatial and temporal resolution in carefully 
      controlled microenvironments. An important class of such behavior is bacterial 
      chemotaxis, which plays a fundamental role in a broad range of processes, including 
      disease pathogenesis, biofilm formation, bioremediation, and even carbon cycling in 
      the ocean. In biophysical research, bacterial chemotaxis represents a powerful model 
      system to understand how cells and organisms sense and respond to gradients. Using 
      microfluidics to study chemotaxis of free-swimming bacteria presents experimental 
      challenges that are distinct from those arising in chemotaxis studies of 
      surface-adherent cells. Recently, these challenges have been met by the development 
      of advanced microdevices, able to generate flow-free, steady gradients of arbitrary 
      shape. Much attention to date has been focused on tool development. Yet, we are now 
      at an exciting turning point where science begins to balance technology. Indeed, 
      recent microfluidic studies provided new insights on both the mechanisms governing 
      bacterial gradient sensing (e.g. tuning of response sensitivity, discrimination 
      between conflicting gradients) and the large-scale consequences of chemotaxis (e.g. 
      in the oceans). Here we outline the principles underlying recently proposed gradient 
      generators for bacterial chemotaxis, illustrate the advantage of the microfluidic 
      approach through selected examples, and identify a broader set of scientific 
      questions that may now be addressed with this rapidly developing technology. The 
      latest generation of microfluidic gradient generators, in particular, holds appeal 
      for both biophysicists seeking to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of bacterial 
      chemotaxis, and ecologists wishing to model chemotaxis in realistic environments. 
      Time is ripe for a deeper integration between technology and biology in fully 
      bringing to bear microfluidics on studies of this fascinating microbial behavior.

AB  - While the cashew culture is focused on processing and commercialization of cashew 
      nuts, the pseudofruit (cashew apples) - highly perishable and of limited acceptance 
      - are mostly wasted. The cashew tree pruning fiber (CTPF) is another interesting 
      cashew byproduct. In this study, films have been made from bacterial cellulose 
      produced from cashew apple juice, and added with lignin (0-15 wt%) and cellulose 
      nanocrystals (0-8 wt%), both from CTPF, which enhanced tensile properties and 
      decreased water vapor permeability of the films. Moreover, lignin, although 
      imparting brown color and opacity to the films, was effective to provide the films 
      with UV-absorbing and antioxidant properties, making the films interesting for 
      packaging of food products susceptible to lipid oxidation. The films did not exhibit 
      antimicrobial activity against bacteria or yeasts.

AB  - The research in eco-friendly and sustainable materials for packaging applications 
      with enhanced barrier, thermo-mechanical, rheological and anti-bacterial properties 
      has accelerated in the last decade. Last decade has witnessed immense interest in 
      employing nanocellulose (NC) as a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to the 
      current synthetic packaging barrier films. This review article gathers the research 
      information on NC as a choice for food packaging material. It reviews on the 
      employment of NC and its various forms including its chemico-physical treatments 
      into bio/polymers and its impact on the performance of nanocomposites for food 
      packaging application. The review reveals the fact that the research trends towards 
      NC based materials are quite promising for Active Packaging (AP) applications, 
      including the Controlled Release Packaging (CRP) and Responsive Packaging (RP). 
      Finally, it summarizes with the challenges of sustainable packaging, gray areas that 
      need an improvement/focus in order to commercially exploit this wonderful material 
      for packaging application.

PG  - 1037-1051
LID - 10.4014/jmb.1712.12017 [doi]
AB  - The genus Rhodococcus is a phylogenetically and catabolically diverse group that has 
      been isolated from diverse environments, including polar and alpine regions, for its 
      versatile ability to degrade a wide variety of natural and synthetic organic 
      compounds. Their metabolic capacity and diversity result from their diverse 
      catabolic genes, which are believed to be obtained through frequent recombination 
      events mediated by large catabolic plasmids. Many rhodococci have been used 
      commercially for the biodegradation of environmental pollutants and for the 
      biocatalytic production of high-value chemicals from low-value materials. Recent 
      studies of their physiology, metabolism, and genome have broadened our knowledge 
      regarding the diverse biotechnological applications that exploit their catabolic 
      enzymes and pathways.

TI  - Deconstruction of Lignin: From Enzymes to Microorganisms.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26082299 [doi]
LID - 2299
AB  - Lignocellulosic residues are low-cost abundant feedstocks that can be used for 
      industrial applications. However, their recalcitrance currently makes lignocellulose 
      use limited. In natural environments, microbial communities can completely 
      deconstruct lignocellulose by synergistic action of a set of enzymes and proteins. 
      Microbial degradation of lignin by fungi, important lignin degraders in nature, has 
      been intensively studied. More recently, bacteria have also been described as able 
      to break down lignin, and to have a central role in recycling this plant polymer. 
      Nevertheless, bacterial deconstruction of lignin has not been fully elucidated yet. 
      Direct analysis of environmental samples using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, 
      and metaproteomics approaches is a powerful strategy to describe/discover enzymes, 
      metabolic pathways, and microorganisms involved in lignin breakdown. Indeed, the use 
      of these complementary techniques leads to a better understanding of the 
      composition, function, and dynamics of microbial communities involved in lignin 
      deconstruction. We focus on omics approaches and their contribution to the discovery 
      of new enzymes and reactions that impact the development of lignin-based 
      bioprocesses.

TI  - A Review on Bacterial Contribution to Lignocellulose Breakdown into Useful 
      Bio-Products.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18116001 [doi]
LID - 6001
AB  - Discovering novel bacterial strains might be the link to unlocking the value in 
      lignocellulosic bio-refinery as we strive to find alternative and cleaner sources of 
      energy. Bacteria display promise in lignocellulolytic breakdown because of their 
      innate ability to adapt and grow under both optimum and extreme conditions. This 
      versatility of bacterial strains is being harnessed, with qualities like adapting to 
      various temperature, aero tolerance, and nutrient availability driving the use of 
      bacteria in bio-refinery studies. Their flexible nature holds exciting promise in 
      biotechnology, but despite recent pointers to a greener edge in the pretreatment of 
      lignocellulose biomass and lignocellulose-driven bioconversion to value-added 
      products, the cost of adoption and subsequent scaling up industrially still pose 
      challenges to their adoption. However, recent studies have seen the use of 
      co-culture, co-digestion, and bioengineering to overcome identified setbacks to 
      using bacterial strains to breakdown lignocellulose into its major polymers and then 
      to useful products ranging from ethanol, enzymes, biodiesel, bioflocculants, and 
      many others. In this review, research on bacteria involved in lignocellulose 
      breakdown is reviewed and summarized to provide background for further research. 
      Future perspectives are explored as bacteria have a role to play in the adoption of 
      greener energy alternatives using lignocellulosic biomass.

LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10408-2 [doi]
AB  - Cheese whey (CW), the liquid resulting from the precipitation and removal of milk 
      casein during cheese-making, and the second cheese whey (SCW) derived from the 
      production of cottage and ricotta cheeses are the main byproducts of dairy industry. 
      The major constituent of CW and SCW is lactose, contributing to the high BOD and COD 
      content. Because of this, CW and SCW are high-polluting agents and their disposal is 
      still a problem for the dairy sector. CW and SCW, however, also consist of lipids, 
      proteins, and minerals, making them useful for production of various compounds. In 
      this paper, microbial processes useful to promote the bioremediation of CW and SCW 
      are discussed, and an overview on the main whey-derived products is provided. 
      Special focus was paid to the production of health-promoting whey drinks, vinegar, 
      and biopolymers, which may be exploited as value-added products in different 
      segments of food and pharmaceutical industries.

TI  - Emergent Biological Endurance Depends on Extracellular Matrix Composition of 
      Three-Dimensionally Printed Escherichia coli Biofilms.
PG  - 2997-3008
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.1c00290 [doi]
AB  - Biofilms are three-dimensional (3D) bacterial communities that exhibit a highly 
      self-organized nature in terms of their composition and complex architecture. 
      Bacteria in biofilms display emergent biological properties, such as resistance to 
      antimicrobials and disinfectants that the individual planktonic cells lack. 
      Bacterial biofilms possess specialized architectural features including unique 
      extracellular matrix compositions and a distinct spatially patterned arrangement of 
      cells and matrix components within the biofilm. It is unclear which of these 
      architectural elements of bacterial biofilms lead to the development of their 
      emergent biological properties. Here, we report a 3D printing-based technique for 
      studying the emergent resistance behaviors of Escherichia coli biofilms as a 
      function of their architecture. Cellulose and curli are the major 
      extracellular-matrix components in E. coli biofilms. We show that 3D-printed 
      biofilms expressing either curli alone or both curli and cellulose in their 
      extracellular matrices show higher resistance to exposure against disinfectants than 
      3D prints expressing either cellulose alone or no biofilm-matrix components. The 
      3D-printed biofilms expressing cellulose and/or curli also show thicker anaerobic 
      zones than nonbiofilm-forming E. coli 3D prints. Thus, the matrix composition plays 
      a crucial role in the emergent spatial patterning and biological endurance of 
      3D-printed biofilms. In contrast, initial spatial distribution of bacterial density 
      or curli-producing cells does not have an effect on biofilm resistance phenotypes. 
      Further, these 3D-printed biofilms could be reversibly attached to different 
      surfaces (bacterial cellulose, glass, and polystyrene) and display resistance to 
      physical distortions by retaining their shape and structure. This physical 
      robustness highlights their potential in applications including bioremediation, 
      protective coatings against pathogens on medical devices, or wastewater treatment, 
      among many others. This new understanding of the emergent behavior of bacterial 
      biofilms could aid in the development of novel engineered living materials using 
      synthetic biology and materials science approaches.

TI  - Bacterial populations and environmental factors controlling cellulose degradation in 
      an acidic Sphagnum peat.
PG  - 1800-14
LID - 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02491.x [doi]
AB  - Northern peatlands represent a major global carbon store harbouring approximately 
      one-third of the global reserves of soil organic carbon. A large proportion of these 
      peatlands consists of acidic Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bogs, which are 
      characterized by extremely low rates of plant debris decomposition. The degradation 
      of cellulose, the major component of Sphagnum-derived litter, was monitored in 
      long-term incubation experiments with acidic (pH 4.0) peat extracts. This process 
      was almost undetectable at 10°C and occurred at low rates at 20°C, while it was 
      significantly accelerated at both temperature regimes by the addition of available 
      nitrogen. Cellulose breakdown was only partially inhibited in the presence of 
      cycloheximide, suggesting that bacteria participated in this process. We aimed to 
      identify these bacteria by a combination of molecular and cultivation approaches and 
      to determine the factors that limit their activity in situ. The indigenous bacterial 
      community in peat was dominated by Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The 
      addition of cellulose induced a clear shift in the community structure towards an 
      increase in the relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes. Increasing temperature and 
      nitrogen availability resulted in a selective development of bacteria 
      phylogenetically related to Cytophaga hutchinsonii (94-95% 16S rRNA gene sequence 
      similarity), which densely colonized microfibrils of cellulose. Among isolates 
      obtained from this community only some subdivision 1 Acidobacteria were capable of 
      degrading cellulose, albeit at a very slow rate. These Acidobacteria represent 
      indigenous cellulolytic members of the microbial community in acidic peat and are 
      easily out-competed by Cytophaga-like bacteria under conditions of increased 
      nitrogen availability. Members of the phylum Firmicutes, known to be key players in 
      cellulose degradation in neutral habitats, were not detected in the cellulolytic 
      community enriched at low pH.

AB  - The ubiquitous bacterial cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) emerges as an 
      important messenger for the control of many bacterial cellular functions including 
      virulence, motility, bioluminescence, cellulose biosynthesis, adhesion, secretion, 
      community behaviour, biofilm formation and cell differentiation. The synthesis of 
      this cyclic nucleotide arises from external stimuli on various signalling domains 
      within the N-terminal region of a dimeric diguanylate cyclase. This initiates the 
      condensation of two molecules of guanosine triphosphate juxtaposed to each other 
      within the C-terminal region of the enzyme. The biofilm from pathogenic microbes is 
      highly resistant to antimicrobial agents suggesting that diguanylate cyclase and its 
      product - c-di-GMP - are key biomedical targets for the inhibition of biofilm 
      development. Furthermore the formation and long-term stability of the aerobic 
      granule, a superior biofilm for biological wastewater treatment, can be controlled 
      by stimulation of c-di-GMP. Any modulation of the synthetic pathways for c-di-GMP is 
      clearly advantageous in terms of medical, industrial and/or environmental 
      bioremediation implications. This review discusses the structure and reaction of 
      individual diguanylate cyclase enzymes with a focus on new directions in c-di-GMP 
      research. Specific attention is made on the molecular mechanisms that control 
      bacterial exopolysaccharide biofilm formation and aerobic granules.

TI  - Bacterial Biotransformation of Pentachlorophenol and Micropollutants Formed during 
      Its Production Process.
LID - 1146
AB  - Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a toxic and persistent wood and cellulose preservative 
      extensively used in the past decades. The production process of PCP generates 
      polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) as 
      micropollutants. PCDD/Fs are also known to be very persistent and dangerous for 
      human health and ecosystem functioning. Several physico-chemical and biological 
      technologies have been used to remove PCP and PCDD/Fs from the environment. 
      Bacterial degradation appears to be a cost-effective way of removing these 
      contaminants from soil while causing little impact on the environment. Several 
      bacteria that cometabolize or use these pollutants as their sole source of carbon 
      have been isolated and characterized. This review summarizes current knowledge on 
      the metabolic pathways of bacterial degradation of PCP and PCDD/Fs. PCP can be 
      successfully degraded aerobically or anaerobically by bacteria. Highly chlorinated 
      PCDD/Fs are more likely to be reductively dechlorinated, while less chlorinated 
      PCDD/Fs are more prone to aerobic degradation. The biochemical and genetic basis of 
      these pollutants' degradation is also described. There are several documented 
      studies of effective applications of bioremediation techniques for the removal of 
      PCP and PCDD/Fs from soil and sediments. These findings suggest that biodegradation 
      can occur and be applied to treat these contaminants.

TI  - Biodegradability of Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate/Bacterial Cellulose Composites under 
      Aerobic Conditions, Measured via Evolution of Carbon Dioxide and Spectroscopic and 
      Diffraction Methods.
PG  - 9979-86
LID - 10.1021/es5044485 [doi]
AB  - Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and bacterial cellulose (BC) are both natural polymeric 
      materials that have the potential to replace traditional, nonrenewable polymers. In 
      particular, the nanofibrillar form of bacterial cellulose makes it an effective 
      reinforcement for PHB. Neat PHB, bacterial cellulose, and a composite of PHB/BC 
      produced with 10 wt % cellulose were composted under accelerated aerobic test 
      conditions, with biodegradability measured by the carbon dioxide evolution method, 
      in conjunction with spectroscopic and diffraction methods to assess crystallinity 
      changes during the biodegradation process. The PHB/BC composite biodegraded at a 
      greater rate and extent than that of PHB alone, reaching 80% degradation after 30 
      days, whereas PHB did not reach this level of degradation until close to 50 days of 
      composting. The relative crystallinity of PHB and PHB in the PHB/BC composite was 
      found to increase in the initial weeks of degradation, with degradation occurring 
      primarily in the amorphous region of the material and some recrystallization of the 
      amorphous PHB. Small angle X-ray scattering indicates that the change in PHB 
      crystallinity is accompanied by a change in morphology of semicrystalline lamellae. 
      The increased rate of biodegradability suggests that these materials could be 
      applicable to single-use applications and could rapidly biodegrade in compost on 
      disposal.

TI  - Microbial gums: introducing a novel functional component of edible coatings and 
      packaging.
PG  - 6853-6866
LID - 10.1007/s00253-019-09966-x [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the accumulation of synthetic plastics has led to the development 
      of a serious environmental problem. Nowadays, biodegradable films and coatings have 
      been identified as a new approach to solve this problem by preparing renewable, 
      abundant, low-cost materials. Gums are considered a large group of polysaccharides 
      and polysaccharide derivatives that can easily form viscous solutions at low 
      concentrations. Gums are mainly soluble in water and are composed of sugars like 
      glucose, fructose, and mannose. These compounds are categorized into three groups: 
      plant-origin gums, seaweed-based gums, and microbial gums. Microbial gums are listed 
      as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration and have 
      a broad range of physicochemical properties suitable for various pharmacy, medicine, 
      and food applications. In the food industry, they can be used as gelling, viscous, 
      stabilizing, and thickening agents. Among the various materials that can potentially 
      improve the properties of biodegradable packaging films, microbial gums such as 
      gellan, xanthan, pullulan, bacterial cellulose, and curdlan have been the subject of 
      numerous studies. These gums can be extruded into films and coatings with 
      considerable barrier properties against the transport of moisture and oxygen. 
      Microbial gums, due to their microbiological stability, adhesion, cohesion, 
      wettability, solubility, transparency, and mechanical properties, can be used as 
      edible films or coatings. Also, these gums can be applied in combination with 
      bioactive compounds that induce the shelf-life extension of highly perishable 
      products. This review focuses on the properties of films and coatings consisting of 
      xanthan, curdlan, pullulan, gellan, and bacterial cellulose.

TI  - Biofuel production from straw hydrolysates: current achievements and perspectives.
PG  - 5105-5116
LID - 10.1007/s00253-019-09863-3 [doi]
AB  - Straw is an agricultural residue of the production of e.g. cereals, rapeseed or 
      sunflowers. It includes dried stalks, leaves, and empty ears and corncobs, which are 
      separated from the grains during harvest. Straw is a promising lignocellulosic 
      feedstock with a beneficial greenhouse gas balance for the production of biofuels 
      and chemicals. Like all lignocellulosic materials, straw is recalcitrant and 
      requires thermochemical and enzymatic pretreatment to enable access to the three 
      major biopolymers of straw-the polysaccharides cellulose and hemicellulose and the 
      polyaromatic compound lignin. Straw is used for commercial ethanol and biogas 
      production. Considerable research has also been conducted to produce biobutanol, 
      biodiesel and biochemicals from this raw material, but more research is required to 
      establish them on a commercial scale. The major hindrance for launching industrial 
      biofuel and chemicals' production from straw is the high cost necessitated by 
      pretreatment of the material. Improvements of microbial strains, production and 
      extraction technologies, as well as co-production of high-value compounds represent 
      ways of establishing straw as feedstock for the production of biofuels, chemicals 
      and food.

TI  - Use of laccase in pulp and paper industry.
PG  - 21-32
LID - 10.1002/btpr.727 [doi]
AB  - Laccase, through its versatile mode of action, has the potential to revolutionize 
      the pulping and paper making industry. It not only plays a role in the 
      delignification and brightening of the pulp but has also been described for the 
      removal of the lipophilic extractives responsible for pitch deposition from both 
      wood and nonwood paper pulps. Laccases are capable of improving physical, chemical, 
      as well as mechanical properties of pulp either by forming reactive radicals with 
      lignin or by functionalizing lignocellulosic fibers. Laccases can also target the 
      colored and toxic compounds released as effluents from various industries and render 
      them nontoxic through its polymerization and depolymerization reactions. This 
      article reviews the use of both fungal and bacterial laccases in improving pulp 
      properties and bioremediation of pulp and paper mill effluents.

      or the ecophysiology of cellulolytic microorganisms from landfills and anaerobic 
      digesters. The aim of this study was to investigate an enriched cellulolytic 
      microbial community from an anaerobic batch reactor. Chemical oxygen demand 
      balancing was used to calculate the cellulose solubilisation rate and the degree of 
      cellulose solubilisation. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used to 
      assess the relative abundance and physical location of three groups of bacteria 
      belonging to the Clostridium lineage of the Firmicutes that have been implicated as 
      the dominant cellulose degraders in this system. Quantitation of the relative 
      abundance using FISH showed that there were changes in the microbial community 
      structure throughout the digestion. However, comparison of these results to the 
      process data reveals that these changes had no impact on the cellulose 
      solubilisation in the reactor. The rate of cellulose solubilisation was 
      approximately stable for much of the digestion despite changes in the cellulolytic 
      population. The solubilisation rate appears to be most strongly affected by the rate 
      of surface area colonisation and the biofilm architecture with the accepted model of 
      first order kinetics due to surface area limitation applying only when the cellulose 
      particles are fully covered with a thin layer of cells.

AB  - Lignocellulose is a term for plant materials that are composed of matrices of 
      cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Lignocellulose is a renewable feedstock for 
      many industries. Lignocellulosic materials are used for the production of paper, 
      fuels, and chemicals. Typically, industry focuses on transforming the 
      polysaccharides present in lignocellulose into products resulting in the incomplete 
      use of this resource. The materials that are not completely used make up the 
      underutilized streams of materials that contain cellulose, hemicellulose, and 
      lignin. These underutilized streams have potential for conversion into valuable 
      products. Treatment of these lignocellulosic streams with bacteria, which 
      specifically degrade lignocellulose through the action of enzymes, offers a 
      low-energy and low-cost method for biodegradation and bioconversion. This review 
      describes lignocellulosic streams and summarizes different aspects of biological 
      treatments including the bacteria isolated from lignocellulose-containing 
      environments and enzymes which may be used for bioconversion. The chemicals produced 
      during bioconversion can be used for a variety of products including adhesives, 
      plastics, resins, food additives, and petrochemical replacements.

AB  - Biofuels from abundantly available cellulosic biomass are an attractive alternative 
      to current petroleum-based fuels (fossil fuels). Although several strategies exist 
      for commercial production of biofuels, conversion of biomass to biofuels via 
      consolidated bioprocessing offers the potential to reduce production costs and 
      increase processing efficiencies. In consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), enzyme 
      production, cellulose hydrolysis, and fermentation are all carried out in a 
      single-step by microorganisms that efficiently employ a multitude of intricate 
      enzymes which act synergistically to breakdown cellulose and its associated cell 
      wall components. Various strategies employed by anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria for 
      biomass hydrolysis are described in this chapter. In addition, the regulation of 
      CAZymes, the role of "omics" technologies in assessing lignocellulolytic ability, 
      and current strategies for improving biomass hydrolysis for optimum biofuel 
      production are highlighted.

TI  - Stable coexistence of five bacterial strains as a cellulose-degrading community.
PG  - 7099-106
AB  - A cellulose-degrading defined mixed culture (designated SF356) consisting of five 
      bacterial strains (Clostridium straminisolvens CSK1, Clostridium sp. strain FG4, 
      Pseudoxanthomonas sp. strain M1-3, Brevibacillus sp. strain M1-5, and Bordetella sp. 
      strain M1-6) exhibited both functional and structural stability; namely, no change 
      in cellulose-degrading efficiency was observed, and all members stably coexisted 
      through 20 subcultures. In order to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the 
      observed stability, "knockout communities" in which one of the members was 
      eliminated from SF356 were constructed. The dynamics of the community structure and 
      the cellulose degradation profiles of these mixed cultures were determined in order 
      to evaluate the roles played by each eliminated member in situ and its impact on the 
      other members of the community. Integration of each result gave the following 
      estimates of the bacterial relationships. Synergistic relationships between an 
      anaerobic cellulolytic bacterium (C. straminisolvens CSK1) and two strains of 
      aerobic bacteria (Pseudoxanthomonas sp. strain M1-3 and Brevibacillus sp. strain 
      M1-5) were observed; the aerobes introduced anaerobic conditions, and C. 
      straminisolvens CSK1 supplied metabolites (acetate and glucose). In addition, there 
      were negative relationships, such as the inhibition of cellulose degradation by 
      producing excess amounts of acetic acid by Clostridium sp. strain FG4, and growth 
      suppression of Bordetella sp. strain M1-6 by Brevibacillus sp. strain M1-5. The 
      balance of the various types of relationships (both positive and negative) is thus 
      considered to be essential for the stable coexistence of the members of this mixed 
      culture.

PG  - 1865-89
LID - 10.1007/s12010-012-9735-3 [doi]
AB  - Bioligninolysis involves living organisms and/or their products in degradation of 
      lignin, which is highly resistant, plant-originated polymer having three-dimensional 
      network of dimethoxylated (syringyl), monomethoxylated (guaiacyl), and 
      non-methoxylated (p-hydroxyphenyl) phenylpropanoid and acetylated units. As a major 
      repository of aromatic chemical structures on earth, lignin bears paramount 
      significance for its removal owing to potential application of bioligninolytic 
      systems in industrial production. Early reports illustrating the discovery and 
      cloning of ligninolytic biocatalysts in fungi was truly a landmark in the field of 
      enzymatic delignification. However, the enzymology for bacterial delignification is 
      hitherto poorly understood. Moreover, the lignin-degrading bacterial genes are still 
      unknown and need further exploration. This review deals with the current knowledge 
      about ligninolytic enzyme families produced by fungi and bacteria, their mechanisms 
      of action, and genetic regulation and reservations, which render them attractive 
      candidates in biotechnological applications.

AB  - Development of an appropriate bioremediation strategy for acid mine drainage (AMD) 
      impacted environment is imperative for sustainable mining but remained critically 
      challenged due to the paucity of knowledge on desired microbiological factors and 
      their nutrient requirements. The present study was conducted to utilize the 
      potential of an anaerobic, acid-tolerant, Fe(3+) and SO(4)(2-) reducing microbial 
      consortium for in situ remediation of highly acidic (pH 3.21), SO(4)(2-) rich 
      (6285 mg/L) mine drainage impacted soil (AIS). A microbial consortium enriched from 
      AMD system and composed of Clostridiales and Bacillales members was characterized 
      and tested for in situ application through microcosms. A combination of 
      bioaugmentation (enriched consortium) and biostimulation (cellulose) allowed 97% 
      reduction in dissolved sulfate and rise in pH up to 7.5. 16S rRNA gene-based 
      amplicon sequencing confirmed that although the bioaugmented community could survive 
      in AIS, availability of carbon source was necessary for superior iron- and sulfate- 
      reduction. Quantitative PCR of dsrB gene confirmed the role of carbon source in 
      boosting the SO(4)(2-) reduction activities of sulfate reducers. This study 
      demonstrated that native AIS harbored limited catabolic activities required for the 
      remediation but addition of catabolically active microbial populations along with 
      necessary carbon and energy source facilitate the bioremediation of AIS.

TI  - Recent advances in biodegradable nanocomposites.
PG  - 497-526
AB  - There is growing interest in developing bio-based products and innovative process 
      technologies that can reduce the dependence on fossil fuel and move to a sustainable 
      materials basis. Biodegradable bio-based nanocomposites are the next generation of 
      materials for the future. Renewable resource-based biodegradable polymers including 
      cellulosic plastic (plastic made from wood), corn-derived plastics, and 
      polyhydroxyalkanoates (plastics made from bacterial sources) are some of the 
      potential biopolymers which, in combination with nanoclay reinforcement, can produce 
      nanocomposites for a variety of applications. Nanocomposites of this category are 
      expected to possess improved strength and stiffness with little sacrifice of 
      toughness, reduced gas/water vapor permeability, a lower coefficient of thermal 
      expansion, and an increased heat deflection temperature, opening an opportunity for 
      the use of new, high performance, lightweight green nanocomposite materials to 
      replace conventional petroleum-based composites. The present review addresses this 
      green material, including its technical difficulties and their solutions.

TI  - Clostridium cellulolyticum: model organism of mesophilic cellulolytic clostridia.
PG  - 741-64
AB  - Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319 is a non-ruminal mesophilic cellulolytic 
      bacterium originally isolated from decayed grass. As with most truly cellulolytic 
      clostridia, C. cellulolyticum possesses an extracellular multi-enzymatic complex, 
      the cellulosome. The catalytic components of the cellulosome release soluble 
      cello-oligosaccharides from cellulose providing the primary carbon substrates to 
      support bacterial growth. As most cellulolytic bacteria, C. cellulolyticum was 
      initially characterised by limited carbon consumption and subsequent limited growth 
      in comparison to other saccharolytic clostridia. The first metabolic studies 
      performed in batch cultures suggested nutrient(s) limitation and/or by-product(s) 
      inhibition as the reasons for this limited growth. In most recent investigations 
      using chemostat cultures, metabolic flux analysis suggests a self-intoxication of 
      bacterial metabolism resulting from an inefficiently regulated carbon flow. The 
      investigation of C. cellulolyticum physiology with cellobiose, as a model of soluble 
      cellodextrin, and with pure cellulose, as a carbon source more closely related to 
      lignocellulosic compounds, strengthen the idea of a bacterium particularly well 
      adapted, and even restricted, to a cellulolytic lifestyle. The metabolic flux 
      analysis from continuous cultures revealed that (i) in comparison to cellobiose, the 
      cellulose hydrolysis by the cellulosome introduces an extra regulation of entering 
      carbon flow resulting in globally lower metabolic fluxes on cellulose than on 
      cellobiose, (ii) the glucose 1-phosphate/glucose 6-phosphate branch point controls 
      the carbon flow directed towards glycolysis and dissipates carbon excess towards the 
      formation of cellodextrins, glycogen and exopolysaccharides, (iii) the 
      pyruvate/acetyl-CoA metabolic node is essential to the regulation of electronic and 
      energetic fluxes. This in-depth analysis of C. cellulolyticum metabolism has 
      permitted the first attempt to engineer metabolically a cellulolytic microorganism.

AB  - Pathogens in the food and environment pose a great threat to human health. To solve 
      this problem, we described a novel route to synthesize antibacterial 
      epsilon-poly-L-lysine (EPL) anchored dicarboxyl cellulose beads. Cellulose beads 
      were prepared via a sol-gel transition method and oxidized by sodium periodate and 
      sodium chlorite to form carboxyl groups. EPL was anchored on the beads using 
      carbodiimide mediated amidation. The structure and morphology of beads were 
      characterized by FTIR, XPS, XRD, SEM, and TGA. After dissolution and regeneration, 
      the crystalline form of cellulose is transformed from cellulose I to cellulose II. 
      The thermal degradation temperature of the beads is 200∼300 °C.The samples displayed 
      excellent antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Alicyclobacillus 
      acidoterrestris and Escherichia coli within 12 h. The beads could be biodegraded in 
      soil after 20 days. The biodegradable beads exhibited great potential in food and 
      environmental applications.

PG  - 927-55
LID - 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00127.x [doi]
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread in various ecosystems and are 
      pollutants of great concern due to their potential toxicity, mutagenicity and 
      carcinogenicity. Because of their hydrophobic nature, most PAHs bind to particulates 
      in soil and sediments, rendering them less available for biological uptake. 
      Microbial degradation represents the major mechanism responsible for the ecological 
      recovery of PAH-contaminated sites. The goal of this review is to provide an outline 
      of the current knowledge of microbial PAH catabolism. In the past decade, the 
      genetic regulation of the pathway involved in naphthalene degradation by different 
      gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria was studied in great detail. Based on both 
      genomic and proteomic data, a deeper understanding of some high-molecular-weight PAH 
      degradation pathways in bacteria was provided. The ability of nonligninolytic and 
      ligninolytic fungi to transform or metabolize PAH pollutants has received 
      considerable attention, and the biochemical principles underlying the degradation of 
      PAHs were examined. In addition, this review summarizes the information known about 
      the biochemical processes that determine the fate of the individual components of 
      PAH mixtures in polluted ecosystems. A deeper understanding of the 
      microorganism-mediated mechanisms of catalysis of PAHs will facilitate the 
      development of new methods to enhance the bioremediation of PAH-contaminated sites.

      importance to human and animal health and physiology, cellulose degradation, solvent 
      production and bioremediation. Their differentiation and related developmental 
      programmes are not well understood at the molecular level. Recent genome sequencing

      events that underlie their unique physiology, capabilities and diversity will pay 
      major dividends.

AB  - This review outlines information about the Gram-negative, aerobic bacterium 
      Variovorax paradoxus. The genomes of these species have G+C contents of 66.5-69.4 
      mol%, and the cells form yellow colonies. Some strains of V. paradoxus are 
      facultative lithoautotrophic, others are chemoorganotrophic. Many of them are 
      associated with important catabolic processes including the degradation of toxic 
      and/or complex chemical compounds. The degradation pathways or other skills related 
      to the following compounds, respectively, are described in this review: sulfolane, 
      3-sulfolene, 2-mercaptosuccinic acid, 3,3'-thiodipropionic acid, aromatic 
      sulfonates, alkanesulfonates, amino acids and other sulfur sources, polychlorinated 
      biphenyls, dimethyl terephthalate, linuron, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, homovanillate, 
      veratraldehyde, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, anthracene, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), 
      chitin, cellulose, humic acids, metal-EDTA complexes, yttrium, rare earth elements, 
      As(III), trichloroethylene, capsaicin, 3-nitrotyrosine, acyl-homoserine lactones, 
      1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, methyl tert-butyl ether, geosmin, and 
      2-methylisoborneol. Strains of V. paradoxus are also engaged in mutually beneficial 
      interactions with other plant and bacterial species in various ecosystems. This 
      species comprises probably promising strains for bioremediation and other 
      biotechnical applications. Lately, the complete genomes of strains S110 and EPS have 
      been sequenced for further investigations.

AB  - Tremendous explosion of population has led to about 200% increment of total energy 
      consumptions in last twenty-five years. Apart from conventional fossil fuel as 
      limited energy source, alternative non-conventional sources are being explored 
      worldwide to cater the energy requirement. Lignocellulosic biomass conversion for 
      biofuel production is an important alternative energy source due to its abundance in 
      nature and creating less harmful impacts on the environment in comparison to the 
      coal or petroleum-based sources. However, lignocellulose biopolymer, the building 
      block of plants, is a recalcitrant substance and difficult to break into desirable 
      products. Commonly used chemical and physical methods for pretreating the substrate 
      are having several limitations. Whereas, utilizing microbial potential to hydrolyse 
      the biomass is an interesting area of research. Because of the complexity of 
      substrate, several enzymes are required that can act synergistically to hydrolyse 
      the biopolymer producing components like bioethanol or other energy substances. 
      Exploring a range of microorganisms, like bacteria, fungi, yeast etc. that utilizes 
      lignocelluloses for their energy through enzymatic breaking down the biomass, is one 
      of the options. Scientists are working upon designing organisms through genetic 
      engineering tools to integrate desired enzymes into a single organism (like 
      bacterial cell). Studies on designer cellulosomes and bacteria consortia development 
      relating consolidated bioprocessing are exciting to overcome the issue of 
      appropriate lignocellulose digestions. This review encompasses up to date 
      information on recent developments for effective microbial degradation processes of 
      lignocelluloses for improved utilization to produce biofuel (bioethanol in 
      particular) from the most plentiful substances of our planet.

AB  - This study aims to explore distinct bacterial strains from wood-feeding termites and 
      to construct novel bacterial consortium for improving the methane yield during 
      anaerobic digestion by degrading birchwood sawdust (BSD) and removing creosote (CRO) 
      compounds simultaneously. A novel bacterial consortium CTB-4 which stands for the 
      molecularly identified species Burkholderia sp., Xanthomonas sp., Shewanella sp., 
      and Pseudomonas mosselii was successfully developed. The CTB-4 consortium showed 
      high efficiency in the removal of naphthalene and phenol. It also revealed reduction 
      in lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose by 19.4, 52.5, and 76.8%, respectively. The 
      main metabolites after the CRO degradation were acetic acid, succinate, pyruvate, 
      and acetaldehyde. Pretreatment of treated BSD mixed with CRO enhanced the total 
      methane yield (162 L/kg VS) by 82.7% and biomass reduction by 54.7% compared to the 
      untreated substrate. CRO showed a toxicity decrease of >90%, suggesting the 
      efficiency of constructed bacterial consortia in bioremediation and biofuel 
      production.

TI  - Unleashing the potential of ligninolytic bacterial contributions towards pulp and 
      paper industry: key challenges and new insights.
PG  - 23349-23368
AB  - Lignocellulose biomass predominantly constitutes the main feedstock for pulp and 
      paper industry. Though some products of pulp and paper industry require the presence 
      of lignin content, for most of the useful products formation lies in the efficient 
      and selective removal of lignin component to make use of the intact cellulose 
      fraction during the pretreatment of pulp. Lignin is a recalcitrant heteropolymer 
      comprised of several complex stable bonds and linkages. The chemicals or intense 
      energy processes used for delignification process release the hazardous chemicals 
      compounds in the wastewater which cause toxicity and environmental pollution. The 
      implementation of bacterial species has elucidated an effective approach in the 
      generation of value-added products while degrading lignin from pulp biomass as well 
      as detoxification of effluent. The direct use of bacterial cells in lignocellulose 
      biomass and wastewater streams is promising as it outperforms the practical and 
      technical constraints largely confronted by fungal and enzymatic means. The present 
      review paper thus unleashed the potential of ligninolytic bacteria towards 
      delignification of pulp biomass and treatment of effluent together with 
      bioconversion of biomass and lignin into value-added products. Graphical abstract 
      Schematic illustration of potential possible contribution of ligninolytic bacteria 
      towards pulp and paper industry.

AB  - Despite recent advances to control the spatial composition and dynamic 
      functionalities of bacteria embedded in materials, bacterial localization into 
      complex three-dimensional (3D) geometries remains a major challenge. We demonstrate 
      a 3D printing approach to create bacteria-derived functional materials by combining 
      the natural diverse metabolism of bacteria with the shape design freedom of additive 
      manufacturing. To achieve this, we embedded bacteria in a biocompatible and 
      functionalized 3D printing ink and printed two types of "living materials" capable 
      of degrading pollutants and of producing medically relevant bacterial cellulose. 
      With this versatile bacteria-printing platform, complex materials displaying 
      spatially specific compositions, geometry, and properties not accessed by standard 
      technologies can be assembled from bottom up for new biotechnological and biomedical 
      applications.

TI  - DDE remediation and degradation.
PG  - 55-69
AB  - DDT and its metabolites, DDD and DDE, have been shown to be recalcitrant to 
      degradation. The parent compound, DDT, was used extensively worldwide starting in 
      1939 and was banned in the United States in 1973. The daughter compound, DDE, may 
      result from aerobic degradation, abiotic dehydrochlorination, or photochemical 
      decomposition. DDE has also occurred as a contaminant in commercial-grade DDT. The 
      p,p'-DDE isomer is more biologically active than the o,p-DDE, with a reported 
      half-life of -5.7 years. However, when DDT was repeatedly applied to the soil, the 
      DDE concentration may remain unchanged for more than 20 yr. Remediation of 
      DDE-contaminated soil and water may be done by several techniques. Phytoremediation 
      involves translocating DDT, DDD, and DDE from the soil into the plant, although some 
      aquatic species (duckweed > elodea > parrot feather) can transform DDT into 
      predominantly DDD with some DDE being formed. Of all the plants that can uptake DDE, 
      Cucurbita pepo has been the most extensively studied, with translocation values 
      approaching "hyperaccumulation" levels. Soil moisture, temperature, and plant 
      density have all been documented as important factors in the uptake of DDE by 
      Cucurbita pepo. Uptake may also be influenced positively by amendments such as 
      biosurfactants, mycorrhizal inoculants, and low molecular weight organic acids 
      (e.g., citric and oxalic acids). DDE microbial degradation by dehalogenases, 
      dioxygenases, and hydrolases occurs under the proper conditions. Although several 
      aerobic degradation pathways have been proposed, none has been fully verified. Very 
      few aerobic pure cultures are capable of fully degrading DDE to CO2. Cometabolism of 
      DDE by Pseudomonas sp., Alicaligens sp., and Terrabacter sp. grown on biphenyl has 
      been reported; however, not all bacterial species that produce biphenyl dioxygenase 
      degraded DDE. Arsenic and copper inhibit DDE degradation by aerobic microorganisms. 
      Similarly, metal chelates such as EDTA inhibit the breakdown of DDE by the 
      extracellular lignolytic enzymes produced by white rot fungi. The addition of 
      adjutants such as sodium ion, surfactants, and cellulose increased the rate of DDT 
      aerobic or anaerobic degradation but did little to enhance the rate of DDE 
      disappearance under anaerobic conditions. Only in the past decade has it been 
      demonstrated that DDE can undergo reductive dechlorination under methanogenic and 
      sulfidogenic conditions to form the degradation product DDMU, 
      1-chloro-2,2'-bis-(4'-chlorophenyl)ethane. The only pure culture reported to degrade 
      DDE under anaerobic conditions was the denitrifier Alcaligens denitrificans. The 
      degradation of DDE by this bacterium was enhanced by glucose, whereas biphenyl fumes 
      had no effect. Abiotic remediation by DDE volatilization was enhanced by flooding 
      and irrigation and deepplowing inhibited the volatilization. The use of zero-valent 
      iron and surfactants in flooded soils enhanced DDT degradation but did not 
      significantly alter the rate of DDE removal. Other catalysts (palladized magnesium, 
      palladium on carbon, and nickel/aluminum alloys) degraded DDT and its metabolites, 
      including DDE. However, these systems are often biphasic or involve explosive gases 
      or both. Safer abiotic alternatives use UV light with titanium oxide or visible 
      light with methylene green to degrade DDT, DDD, and DDE in aqueous or mixed solvent 
      systems. Remediation and degradation of DDE in soil and water by phytoextraction, 
      aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, or abiotic methods can be accomplished. 
      However, success has been limited, and great care must be taken that the method does 
      not transfer the contaminants to another locale (by volatilization, deep plowing, 
      erosion, or runoff) or to another species (by ingestion of accumulating plants or 
      contaminated water). Although the remediation of DDT-, DDD-, and DDE-contaminated 
      soil and water is beset with myriad problems, there remain many open avenues of 
      research.

AB  - Microbial deterioration accounts for a significant percentage of the degradation 
      processes that occur on archeological/historical objects and artworks, and 
      identifying the causative agents of such a phenomenon should therefore be a 
      priority, in consideration of the need to conserve these important cultural heritage 
      items. Diverse microbiological approaches, such as microscopic evaluations, cultural 
      methods, metabolic- and DNA-based techniques, as well as a combination of the 
      aforementioned methods, have been employed to characterize the bacterial, archaeal, 
      and fungal communities that colonize art objects. The purpose of the present review 
      article is to report the interactions occurring between the microorganisms and 
      nutrients that are present in stones, bones, wood, paper, films, paintings, and 
      modern art specimens (namely, collagen, cellulose, gelatin, albumin, lipids, and 
      hydrocarbons). Some examples, which underline that a good knowledge of these 
      interactions is essential to obtain an in depth understanding of the factors that 
      favor colonization, are reported. These data can be exploited both to prevent damage 
      and to obtain information on historical aspects that can be decrypted through the 
      study of microbial population successions.

PG  - 121-8
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum ( C. thermocellum ) is the dominant microorganism that can 
      efficiently degrade lignocellulose. Extensive studies were done for secreting the 
      cell surface-bound protein complex known as the cellulosome. C. thermocellum is 
      regulated by carbon sources, reflected in overall multiple cellulase production and 
      in the cellulosomal subunit profile. To produce a cellulosomal protein complex is a 
      dynamic assembly process. In recent years, it becomes a hotspot to study how C. 
      thermocellum senses the insoluble substrate, regulates the secretion of relevant 
      enzymes, and assembles the supramolecular-degradation enzyme complex. This review 
      summarized the research advance in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and 
      extracellular carbohydrate-sensing mechanism in C. thermocellum, and analyzed the 
      mechanism and dynamic process of C. thermocellum in lignocellulose degradation.

TI  - Adventures in Rhodococcus - from steroids to explosives.
PG  - 155-68
LID - 10.1139/W10-115 [doi]
AB  - Rhodococcus is a genus of mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes that utilize a 
      remarkable variety of organic compounds as growth substrates. This degradation helps 
      maintain the global carbon cycle and has increasing applications ranging from the 
      biodegradation of pollutants to the biocatalytic production of drugs and hormones. 
      We have been using Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 as a model organism to understand the 
      catabolic versatility of Rhodococcus and related bacteria. Our approach is 
      exemplified by the discovery of a cluster of genes specifying the catabolism of 
      cholesterol. This degradation proceeds via β-oxidative degradation of the side chain 
      and O2-dependent cleavage of steroid ring A in a process similar to bacterial 
      degradation of aromatic compounds. The pathway is widespread in Actinobacteria and 
      is critical to the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, arguably the world's 
      most successful pathogen. The close similarity of some of these enzymes with 
      biphenyl- and polychlorinated-biphenyl-degrading enzymes that we have characterized 
      is facilitating inhibitor design. Our studies in RHA1 have also provided important 
      insights into a number of novel metalloenzymes and their biosynthesis, such as 
      acetonitrile hydratase (ANHase), a cobalt-containing enzyme with no significant 
      sequence identity with characterized nitrile hydratases. Molecular genetic and 
      biochemical studies have identified AnhE as a dimeric metallochaperone that delivers 
      cobalt to ANHase, enabling its maturation in vivo. Other metalloenzymes we are 
      characterizing include N-acetylmuramic acid hydroxylase, which catalyzes an unusual 
      hydroxylation of the rhodococcal and mycobacterial peptidoglycan, and 2 RHA1 
      dye-decolorizing peroxidases. Using molecular genetic and biochemical approaches, we 
      have demonstrated that one of these enzymes is involved in the degradation of 
      lignin. Overall, our studies are providing fundamental insights into a range of 
      catabolic processes that have a wide variety of applications.

      wound healing and photocatalysis.

AB  - Cellulose is the natural biopolymer normally used as supporting agent with enhanced 
      applicability and properties. In present study, cellulose isolated from citrus waste 
      is used for silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) impregnation by a simple and reproducible 
      method. The Ag-NPs fabricated cellulose (Ag-Cel) was characterised by powder X-rays 
      diffraction, Fortier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron 
      microscopy. The thermal stability was studied by thermo-gravimetric analysis. The 
      antibacterial activity performed by disc diffusion assay reveals good zone of 
      inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by Ag-Cel as compared 
      Ag-NPs. The discs also displayed more than 90% reduction of S. aureus culture in 
      broth within 150 min. The Ag-Cel discs also demonstrated minor 2,2-diphenyl 
      1-picryl-hydrazyl radical scavenging activity and total reducing power ability while 
      moderate total antioxidant potential was observed. Ag-Cel effectively degrades 
      methylene-blue dye up to 63.16% under sunlight irradiation in limited exposure time 
      of 60 min. The Ag-NPs impregnated cellulose can be effectively used in wound 
      dressing to prevent bacterial attack and scavenger of free radicals at wound site, 
      and also as filters for bioremediation and wastewater purification.

      implications for the role of polysaccharide matrix interactions in plant cell wall 
      biodegradability.
PG  - 1727-33
AB  - Growth of the cellulose-synthesizing bacterium Acetobacter xylinum ATCC 53524 in 
      media supplemented with 5% (w/v) glucose and 0.2% (w/v) of a water-soluble, nearly 
      linear xylan from tobacco stalks resulted in the synthesis of a highly crystalline 
      composite having a xylose/glucose ratio ranging from 0.06 to 0.24. The digestion of 
      one composite (88% cellulose/12% xylan) by mixed ruminal microflora displayed 
      kinetics of gas production similar to those of an unassociated mixture of the two 
      components added in a xylan/cellulose ratio similar to that of the composite. The 
      data suggest that intimate association of xylan and cellulose, as is typically found 
      in secondary plant cell walls, does not inhibit the rate of digestion of the 
      component polysaccharides.

AB  - The huge applications of cellulosic and lignocellulosic materials in the various 
      fields of life lead to accumulation of its wastes that became one of the major 
      sources of environmental pollution. In this study, a Gram-positive 
      cellulose-decomposing endophytic bacterium (Chi-04) was isolated from medicinal 
      plant Chiliadenus montanus which inhabitant Saint Catherine (Sinai) region in Egypt. 
      The bacterial strain was identified based on the sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes 
      as Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus. This isolate was capable of degrading 58% of 
      cellulosic filter paper (100 g/l) within 15 days of incubation. The soluble and 
      reduced sugars were spectrophotometrically determined as cellulose decomposition 
      metabolites. The bacterial isolate exhibited an obvious activity toward cellulase 
      enzyme production. The maximum cellulase activity (0.18 U/min) was detected after 
      12 days of incubation while the maximum release of soluble sugars (11.85 mg/ml) was 
      detected after 15 days of incubation. CaCl(2) nanoparticles (100 nm) were chemically 
      prepared to enhance the activity of the enzyme. The optimum concentration of CaCl(2) 
      nanoparticles that showed the highest activity of cellulase (0.3 mg/ml reduced 
      sugar) was 0.6%. The bacterial isolates showed potential convert of cellulose into 
      reducing sugars which could be used in several applications.

TI  - Antimicrobial edible films and coatings.
PG  - 833-48
AB  - Increasing consumer demand for microbiologically safer foods, greater convenience, 
      smaller packages, and longer product shelf life is forcing the industry to develop 
      new food-processing, cooking, handling, and packaging strategies. Nonfluid 
      ready-to-eat foods are frequently exposed to postprocess surface contamination, 
      leading to a reduction in shelf life. The food industry has at its disposal a wide 
      range of nonedible polypropylene- and polyethylene-based packaging materials and 
      various biodegradable protein- and polysaccharide-based edible films that can 
      potentially serve as packaging materials. Research on the use of edible films as 
      packaging materials continues because of the potential for these films to enhance 
      food quality, food safety, and product shelf life. Besides acting as a barrier 
      against mass diffusion (moisture, gases, and volatiles), edible films can serve as 
      carriers for a wide range of food additives, including flavoring agents, 
      antioxidants, vitamins, and colorants. When antimicrobial agents such as benzoic 
      acid, sorbic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, nisin, and lysozyme have been 
      incorporated into edible films, such films retarded surface growth of bacteria, 
      yeasts, and molds on a wide range of products, including meats and cheeses. Various 
      antimicrobial edible films have been developed to minimize growth of spoilage and 
      pathogenic microorganisms, including Listeria monocytogenes, which may contaminate 
      the surface of cooked ready-to-eat foods after processing. Here, we review the 
      various types of protein-based (wheat gluten, collagen, corn zein, soy, casein, and 
      whey protein), polysaccharide-based (cellulose, chitosan, alginate, starch, pectin, 
      and dextrin), and lipid-based (waxes, acylglycerols, and fatty acids) edible films 
      and a wide range of antimicrobial agents that have been or could potentially be 
      incorporated into such films during manufacture to enhance the safety and shelf life 
      of ready-to-eat foods.

AB  - Waste straw bio-transformation of high value-added macromolecule 
      polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) was significance to environmental sustainable 
      development. As a member of the PHA family, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) could be 
      synthesized by Halomonas elongata A1 with maximal yields of 22.8% and 11.8% of 
      bacterial weights using glucose and carboxymethyl cellulose as carbon sources, 
      respectively. To improve PHB production, we generated three recombinant strains, the 
      H. elongata P2 with highest PHB biosynthesis ability. When wheat straw, mixed 
      substrate and oleic acid were individually used as single carbon source, the maximal 
      PHA polymer accumulation in the H. elongata P2 reached 5.2%, 16.5% and 27.5%, 
      respectively, after 84 h of cultivation. This hardness, toughness and 
      crystallization properties of the PHA macromolecule altered dependent on starting 
      substrates, when analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform 
      infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In terms 
      of the hardness and roughness, the PHA produced from mixed substrates was much 
      softer than that from wheat straw but harder than that from oleic acid. The 
      long-chain carbon improved the softness and strength of the produced PHA. Our data 
      indicate that economical substrates, such as straw and waste oil, can be used in the 
      synthesis of multi-functional plastic products with biodegradable properties.

TI  - Synergistic and Regulatable Bioremediation Capsules Fabrication Based on 
      Vapor-Phased Encapsulation of Bacillus Bacteria and its Regulator by 
      Poly-p-Xylylene.
LID - 10.3390/polym13010041 [doi]
LID - 41
AB  - A regulatable bioremediation capsule material was synthesized with isolated 
      single-strain bacteria (Bacillus species, B. CMC1) and a regulator molecule 
      (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC) by a vapor-phased encapsulation method with simple 
      steps of water sublimation and poly-p-xylylene deposition in chemical vapor 
      deposition (CVD) process. Mechanically, the capsule construct exhibited a 
      controllable shape and dimensions, and was composed of highly biocompatible 
      poly-p-xylylene as the matrix with homogeneously distributed bacteria and CMC 
      molecules. Versatility of the encapsulation of the molecules at the desired 
      concentrations was achieved in the vapor-phased sublimation and deposition 
      fabrication process. The discovery of the fabricated capsule revealed that viable 
      living B. CMC1 inhabited the capsule, and the capsule enhanced bacterial growth due 
      to the materials and process used. Biologically, the encapsulated B. CMC1 
      demonstrated viable and functional enzyme activity for cellulase activation, and 
      such activity was regulatable and proportional to the concentration of the decorated 
      CMC molecules in the same capsule construct. Impressively, 13% of cellulase activity 
      increase was realized by encapsulation of B. CMC1 by poly-p-xylylene, and a further 
      34% of cellulase activity increase was achieved by encapsulation of additional 2.5% 
      CMC. Accordingly, this synergistic effectiveness of the capsule constructs was 
      established by combining enzymatic B. CMC1 bacteria and its regulatory CMC by 
      poly-p-xylylene encapsulation process. This reported encapsulation process exhibited 
      other advantages, including the use of simple steps and a dry and clean process free 
      of harmful chemicals; most importantly, the process is scalable for mass production. 
      The present study represents a novel method to fabricate bacteria-encapsulated 
      capsule for cellulose degradation in bioremediation that can be used in various 
      applications, such as wastewater treatment and transforming of cellulose into 
      glucose for biofuel production. Moreover, the concept of this vapor-phased 
      encapsulation technology can be correspondingly used to encapsulate multiple 
      bacteria and regulators to enhance the specific enzyme functions for degradation of 
      various organic matters.

TI  - Parameter and process significance in mechanistic modeling of cellulose hydrolysis.
PG  - 5738-48
AB  - A process-based model relevant to landfill and anaerobic digesters was developed, 
      which included a novel approach to biomass transfer between a cellulose-bound 
      biofilm and biomass in the bulk liquid. Model results highlighted the significance 
      of the bacterial colonization of cellulose particles by attachment through contact 
      in solution. Simulations revealed that both enhanced colonization and cellulose 
      degradation are associated with reduced cellulose particle size, increased biomass 
      populations in solution and increased cellulose-binding ability of the biomass. This 
      suggests that transportation of biomass into the system from elsewhere and/or 
      bacterial inoculation of such systems could enhance degradation significantly. A 
      sensitivity analysis of the system parameters revealed the biological rate and yield 
      properties of the hydrolyzing bacteria are most significant with regard to cellulose 
      degradation in the system.

PG  - 702-709
LID - 10.1007/s00284-019-01856-9 [doi]
AB  - In this work we investigated the enzymes produced by Bacillus aryabhattai BA03, 
      particularly in those involved in ligninolytic activities such as laccases (Lac), 
      lignin peroxidases (LiP) and Mn-dependent peroxidase (MnD-P). In this way, the 
      maximal production of Lac (0.069 ± 0.000 U/mL) was obtained at pH 9, and 37 ºC after 
      72 h. LiP expressed the highest activity at 96 h in acid medium at 37 ºC 
      (0.741 ± 0.029 U/mL). Meanwhile, the strain produced MnD-P (1.052 ± 0.001 U/mL) at 
      the highest temperature assayed (44 ºC) and pH 7 at 72 h. In addition, this 
      microorganism produced resistant endospores able to germinate after the 
      sterilization program (121 ºC, 15 min) showing a high enzymatic activity. Using the 
      heat-treated culture as inoculum, the percentage of decolorization of 150 mg/L of 
      Coomassie Brillant Blue reached 89.42 ± 0.11% in only 24 h. These results open the 
      use of these enzymes and endospores in bioremediation processes carried out under 
      different temperatures and pH values.

TI  - Giving structure to the biofilm matrix: an overview of individual strategies and 
      emerging common themes.
PG  - 649-69
LID - 10.1093/femsre/fuv015 [doi]
AB  - Biofilms are communities of microbial cells that underpin diverse processes 
      including sewage bioremediation, plant growth promotion, chronic infections and 
      industrial biofouling. The cells resident in the biofilm are encased within a 
      self-produced exopolymeric matrix that commonly comprises lipids, proteins that 
      frequently exhibit amyloid-like properties, eDNA and exopolysaccharides. This matrix 
      fulfils a variety of functions for the community, from providing structural rigidity 
      and protection from the external environment to controlling gene regulation and 
      nutrient adsorption. Critical to the development of novel strategies to control 
      biofilm infections, or the capability to capitalize on the power of biofilm 
      formation for industrial and biotechnological uses, is an in-depth knowledge of the 
      biofilm matrix. This is with respect to the structure of the individual components, 
      the nature of the interactions between the molecules and the three-dimensional 
      spatial organization. We highlight recent advances in the understanding of the 
      structural and functional role that carbohydrates and proteins play within the 
      biofilm matrix to provide three-dimensional architectural integrity and 
      functionality to the biofilm community. We highlight, where relevant, experimental 
      techniques that are allowing the boundaries of our understanding of the biofilm 
      matrix to be extended using Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio 
      cholerae, and Bacillus subtilis as exemplars.

AB  - Herbicides have the potential to impair the metabolism of soil microorganisms. The 
      current study addressed the toxic effect of bentazon and 
      4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid on aerobic and anaerobic Bacteria that are 
      involved in cellulose and cellobiose degradation in an agricultural soil. Aerobic 
      saccharide degradation was reduced at concentrations of herbicides above 
      environmental values. Microbial processes (e.g. fermentations, ferric iron 
      reduction) that were linked to anaerobic cellulose and cellobiose degradation were 
      reduced in the presence of both herbicides at concentrations above and at those that 
      occur in crop field soil. 16S rRNA gene transcript numbers of total Bacteria, and 
      selected bacterial taxa (Clostridia [Group I], Planctomycetaceae, and two 
      uncultivated taxa of Bacteroidetes) decreased more in anoxic than in oxic 
      cellulose-supplemented soil microcosms in the presence of both herbicides. 
      Collectively, the results suggested that the metabolism of anaerobic 
      cellulose-degrading Bacteria was impaired by typical in situ herbicide 
      concentrations, whereas in situ concentrations did not impair metabolism of aerobic 
      cellulose- and cellobiose-degrading soil Bacteria.

TI  - The second green revolution? Production of plant-based biodegradable plastics.
PG  - 219-32
LID - 10.1042/BJ20081769 [doi]
AB  - Biodegradable plastics are those that can be completely degraded in landfills, 
      composters or sewage treatment plants by the action of naturally occurring 
      micro-organisms. Truly biodegradable plastics leave no toxic, visible or 
      distinguishable residues following degradation. Their biodegradability contrasts 
      sharply with most petroleum-based plastics, which are essentially indestructible in 
      a biological context. Because of the ubiquitous use of petroleum-based plastics, 
      their persistence in the environment and their fossil-fuel derivation, alternatives 
      to these traditional plastics are being explored. Issues surrounding waste 
      management of traditional and biodegradable polymers are discussed in the context of 
      reducing environmental pressures and carbon footprints. The main thrust of the 
      present review addresses the development of plant-based biodegradable polymers. 
      Plants naturally produce numerous polymers, including rubber, starch, cellulose and 
      storage proteins, all of which have been exploited for biodegradable plastic 
      production. Bacterial bioreactors fed with renewable resources from 
      plants--so-called 'white biotechnology'--have also been successful in producing 
      biodegradable polymers. In addition to these methods of exploiting plant materials 
      for biodegradable polymer production, the present review also addresses the advances 
      in synthesizing novel polymers within transgenic plants, especially those in the 
      polyhydroxyalkanoate class. Although there is a stigma associated with transgenic 
      plants, especially food crops, plant-based biodegradable polymers, produced as 
      value-added co-products, or, from marginal land (non-food), crops such as 
      switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), have the potential to become viable alternatives 
      to petroleum-based plastics and an environmentally benign and carbon-neutral source 
      of polymers.

AB  - Bark beetles reproduce and overwinter under the bark of trees, and are associated 
      with bacteria that may influence the fitness of their hosts. As regard the aim of 
      this study was to test the metabolic potential of bacterial strains, isolated from 
      the bark beetle species Cryphalus piceae, Ips typographus and Pityophthorus 
      pityophthorus and collected in the Czech Republic from fir, spruce and pine trees, 
      respectively, to degrade plant cell compounds. The bacterial strains were identified 
      as belonging to the genera Curtobacterium, Erwinia, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Rahnella, 
      Staphylococcus, and Yersinia. Several activities related to the degradation of 
      lignocellulosic materials, such as cellulose, xylan and starch, were found. 
      Moreover, the genomes of three of these strains were sequenced and analyzed, and the 
      presence of the enzymatic machinery required for biomass hydrolysis was discovered. 
      This finding supports the idea that bacteria aid in the provision of nutrients to 
      the beetle from the hydrolysis of tree compounds, results that are relevant for 
      studying the ecological implication of bacterial strains in the bark beetle life 
      cycle. In addition, the activities found in association with the bacterial strains 
      could be useful in biotechnological processes, such as the production of biofuels 
      from biomass, colorant degradation, in the textile industry and for wastewater 
      treatments. Furthermore, the gene sequences of the lignocellulolytic enzymes found 
      within the genomes serve as a basis for future studies regarding the potential 
      application of these bacteria, and their metabolic machinery, in processes such as 
      biomass hydrolysis and bioremediation.

TI  - Photocatalytic and biodegradation treatments of paracetamol: investigation of the in 
      vivo toxicity.
PG  - 14530-14545
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-11615-0 [doi]
AB  - Medicines and drugs consumption by all populations of the world can be expected to 
      result in the contamination of the environment since 30-90% of residual drugs will 
      be found into wastewaters. In this study, we investigate the degradation of 
      acetaminophen, selected as a xenobiotic model molecule, via two separate procedures, 
      the TiO(2) impregnated on cellulosic paper photocatalysis, and specific bacterial 
      biodegradation process. Results showed that for initial drug content of 400 mg/L and 
      after 5 hours of processing, around 85% of paracetamol was photocatalytically 
      degraded. The use of Pseudomonas putida E1.21 isolate allowed an abatement of around 
      92% after 32 h of processing. The acetaminophen toxicity conducted in vivo on 
      laboratory mice showed a net decrease of the creatinine release and enzymes 
      activities like ALP, ALT, AST, and LDH decreased significantly (p < 0.05) when mice 
      were treated distinctly by acetaminophen treated with UV/TiO(2) and the Pseudomonas 
      putida E1.21 strain compared with the control experiments. CAT, MDA, and AchE serum 
      level disruption measurement indicated a serious affection of the mice antioxidant 
      system. These results were found to be in correlation with the ones of the 
      histological analysis of the liver and kidney.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Laccase for Lignin Degradation, LacZ1.
PG  - e0135521

LID - e01355-21
AB  - Lignin is a complex natural organic polymer and is one of the primary components of 
      lignocellulose. The efficient utilization of lignocellulose is limited because it is 
      difficult to degrade lignin. In this study, we screened a lacz1 gene fragment 
      encoding laccase from the macrotranscriptome data of a microbial consortium WSC-6, 
      which can efficiently degrade lignocellulose. The reverse transcription-quantitative 
      PCR (RT-qPCR) results demonstrated that the expression level of the lacz1 gene 
      during the peak period of lignocellulose degradation by WSC-6 increased by 30.63 
      times compared to the initial degradation period. Phylogenetic tree analysis 
      demonstrated that the complete lacz1 gene is derived from a Bacillus sp. and encoded 
      laccase. The corresponding protein, LacZ1, was expressed and purified by 
      Ni-chelating affinity chromatography. The optimum temperature was 75°C, the optimum 
      pH was 4.5, and the highest enzyme activity reached 16.39 U/mg. We found that Cu(2+) 
      was an important cofactor needed for LacZ1 to have enzyme activity. The molecular 
      weight distribution of lignin was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 
      and changes in the lignin structure were determined by (1)H nuclear magnetic 
      resonance ((1)H NMR) spectra. The degradation products of lignin by LacZ1 were 
      determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and three lignin 
      degradation pathways (the gentian acid pathway, benzoic acid pathway, and 
      protocatechuic acid pathway) were proposed. This study provides insight into the 
      degradation of lignin and new insights into high-temperature bacterial laccase. 
      IMPORTANCE Lignin is a natural aromatic polymer that is not easily degraded, 
      hindering the efficient use of lignocellulose-rich biomass resources, such as straw. 
      Biodegradation is a method of decomposing lignin that has recently received 
      increasing attention. In this study, we screened a gene encoding laccase from the 
      lignocellulose-degrading microbial consortium WSC-6, purified the corresponding 
      protein LacZ1, characterized the enzymatic properties of laccase LacZ1, and 
      speculated that the degradation pathway of LacZ1 degrades lignin. This study 
      identified a new, high-temperature bacterial laccase that can degrade lignin, 
      providing insight into lignin degradation by this laccase.

AB  - Bacteria face diverse stresses in the environment and, sometimes, respond by forming 
      multi-cellular structures, e.g., biofilms. Here, we report a novel macroscopic and 
      multi-cellular structure formed by Salmonella Typhimurium, which resembles small 
      strings. These string-like structures, ∼1 cm long, are induced under some stress 
      conditions: iron deprivation by 2,2-Bipyridyl or low amounts of antibiotics or 
      ethanol in minimal media. However, cells in strings revert back to planktonic growth 
      upon return to nutrient rich media. Compared to planktonic cells, strings are more 
      resistant to antibiotics and oxidative stress. Also, strains lacking csgD or rpoS, 
      which are defective in the classical rdar biofilm formation, form strings. 
      Furthermore, some biofilm inducing conditions do not result in strings and 
      vice-versa, demonstrating that strings are not related to classical CsgD-dependent 
      biofilms. Cells in a string are held together by cellulose and a strain lacking 
      bcsA, which is defective in cellulose production, does not form strings. In 
      addition, reductive stress conditions such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or mutations in 
      the Disulfide bonding system (DSB) also give rise to strings. The amounts of 
      c-di-GMP are increased upon string formation and studies with single and double 
      deletion strains of the diguanylate cyclases, yedQ (STM1987) primarily and yfiN 
      (STM2672) partly, revealed their importance for string formation. This is the first 
      study showcasing the ability of Salmonella to produce high amounts of cellulose in 
      liquid culture, instead of an interface, in a CsgD-independent manner. The relevance 
      and possible applications of strings in the production of bacterial cellulose and 
      bioremediation are discussed.

TI  - Process Analysis of Anaerobic Fermentation Exposure to Metal Mixtures.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16142458 [doi]
LID - 2458
AB  - Anaerobic fermentation is a cost-effective biowaste disposal approach. During 
      fermentation, microorganisms require a trace amount of metals for optimal growth and 
      performance. This study investigated the effects of metal mixtures on biogas 
      properties, process stability, substrate degradation, enzyme activity, and microbial 
      communities during anaerobic fermentation. The addition of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), 
      and zinc (Zn) into a copper (Cu)-stressed fermentation system resulted in higher 
      cumulative biogas yields, ammonia nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N) concentrations and coenzyme 
      F(420) activities. Ni and Zn addition enhanced process stability and acetate 
      utilization. The addition of these metals also improved and brought forward the peak 
      daily biogas yields as well as increased CH(4) content to 88.94 and 86.58%, 
      respectively. Adding Zn into the Cu-stressed system improved the abundance of 
      Defluviitoga, Fibrobacter and Methanothermobacter, the degradation of cellulose, and 
      the transformation of CO(2) to CH(4). The bacterial and archaeal communities were 
      responsible for the degradation of lignocelluloses and CH(4) production during the 
      fermentation process. This study supports the reutilization of heavy 
      metal-contaminated biowaste and provides references for further research on heavy 
      metals impacted anaerobic fermentation.

TI  - Study and valorisation of wastewaters generated in the production of bacterial 
      nanocellulose.
PG  - 47-56
LID - 10.1007/s10532-020-09893-z [doi]
AB  - Two culture media were tested for the production of bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) 
      under static culture fermentation, one containing molasses (Mol-HS), the other 
      molasses and corn steep liquor (Mol-CSL), as a source of carbon and nitrogen, 
      respectively. These are low-cost nutrients widely available, which provide very good 
      BNC productivities. However, the use of these substrates generates wastewaters with 
      high organic loads. Anaerobic digestion is one of the most promising treatments for 
      industrial wastewaters with high organic loads since, beyond removal of the organic 
      matter, it generates energy, in form of biogas. The wastewaters from BNC 
      fermentation were thus evaluated for their biochemical methane potential through 
      anaerobic digestion. For this, two wastewaters streams were collected: (i) the 
      culture medium obtained after fermentation (WaF) and (ii) the WaF combined with BNC 
      washing wastewaters (WaW). These two effluents-WaF and WaW-were characterized 
      regarding their chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total and volatile solids, 
      to assess their suitability for anaerobic digestion. The biochemical methane 
      potential of WaF and WaW from Mol-CSL wastewaters was (387 ± 14 L kg(-1) VS) and 
      (354 ± 4 L kg(-1) VS), corresponding to a methanization percentage of (86.9 ± 3.1) % 
      and (79.5 ± 0.9) %, respectively. After treatment, the chemical oxygen demand of WaF 
      and WaW was reduced by (89.2 ± 0.4) and (88.7 ± 1.5), respectively. An exploratory 
      test using an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket reactor for WaW treatment was also 
      performed. The reactor was operated with a organic loading rate of [(6.5 ± 0.1) g 
      L(-1) d(-1)] and hydraulic retention time of 3.33 days, allowing a chemical oxygen 
      demand removal of 58% of WaW. Results here obtained demonstrate, for the first time, 
      the high potential of AD for the valorisation of the BNC fermentation wastewaters.

TI  - Cellulose catabolism by Clostridium cellulolyticum growing in batch culture on 
      defined medium.
PG  - 2461-70
AB  - A reinvestigation of cellulose degradation by Clostridium cellulolyticum in a 
      bioreactor with pH control of the batch culture and using a defined medium was 
      performed. Depending on cellulose concentration, the carbon flow distribution was 
      affected, showing the high flexibility of the metabolism. With less than 6.7 g of 
      cellulose liter(-1), acetate, ethanol, H(2), and CO(2) were the main end products of 
      the fermentation and cellulose degradation reached more than 85% in 5 days. The 
      electron flow from the glycolysis was balanced by the production of H(2) and 
      ethanol, the latter increasing with increasing initial cellulose concentration. From 
      6.7 to 29.1 g of cellulose liter(-1), the percentage of cellulose degradation 
      declined; most of the cellulase activity remained on the cellulose fibers, the 
      maximum cell density leveled off, and the carbon flow was reoriented from ethanol to 
      acetate. In addition to that of previously indicated end products, lactate 
      production rose, and, surprisingly enough, pyruvate overflow occurred. Concomitantly 
      the molar growth yield and the energetic yield of the biomass decreased. Growth 
      arrest may be linked to sufficiently high carbon flow, leading to the accumulation 
      of an intracellular inhibitory compound(s), as observed on cellobiose (E. Guedon, M. 
      Desvaux, S. Payot, and H. Petitdemange, Microbiology 145:1831-1838, 1999). These 
      results indicated that bacterial metabolism exhibited on cellobiose was distorted 
      compared to that exhibited on a substrate more closely related to the natural 
      ecosystem of C. cellulolyticum. To overcome growth arrest and to improve degradation 
      at high cellulose concentrations (29.1 g liter(-1)), a reinoculation mode was 
      evaluated. This procedure resulted in an increase in the maximum dry weight of cells 
      (2,175 mg liter(-1)), cellulose solubilization (95%), and end product concentrations 
      compared to a classical batch fermentation with a final dry weight of cells of 580 
      mg liter(-1) and 45% cellulose degradation within 18 days.

AB  - In this study, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze 
      the composition and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities in mushroom 
      residue samples at different composting stages. During the composting process, the 
      maximum temperature in the center of the pile can reach 52.4°C, and the temperature 
      above 50°C has been maintained for about 8 days. The results showed that 
      Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi were the 
      main microorganisms in the composting process, accounting for 98.9%-99.7% of the 
      total bacteria. Furthermore, in order to obtain the protein expressed in each stage 
      of composting, the nonstandard quantitative method (label free) was used to analyze 
      it quantitatively by mass spectrometry, anda total of 22815 proteins were 
      identified. It indicated that the number of identified proteins related to cellulose 
      decomposition and the number of differentially expressed proteins were significantly 
      enriched, and the functional proteins related to cellulose decomposition had 
      significant stage correspondence.

AB  - Cellulose is reputedly the most abundant organic polymer in the biosphere, yet 
      despite the fundamental role of cellulolytic microorganisms in global carbon cycling 
      and as potential sources of novel enzymes for biotechnology, their identity and 
      ecology is not well established. Cellulose is a major component of landfill waste 
      and its degradation is therefore a key feature of the anaerobic microbial 
      decomposition process. Here, we targeted a number of taxa containing known 
      cellulolytic anaerobes (members of the bacterial genus Fibrobacter, lineages of 
      Clostridium clusters I, III, IV and XIV, and anaerobic fungi of the 
      Neocallimastigales) in landfill leachate and colonized cellulose 'baits' via PCR and 
      quantitative PCR (qPCR). Fibrobacter spp. and Clostridium clusters III, IV and XIV 
      were detected in almost all leachate samples and cluster III and XIV clostridia were 
      the most abundant (1-6% and 1-17% of total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies 
      respectively). Two landfill leachate microcosms were constructed to specifically 
      assess those microbial communities that colonize and degrade cellulose substrates in 
      situ. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of colonized cotton revealed extensive 
      cellulose degradation in one microcosm, and Fibrobacter spp. and Clostridium cluster 
      III represented 29% and 17%, respectively, of total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies 
      in the biofilm. Visible cellulose degradation was not observed in the second 
      microcosm, and this correlated with negligible relative abundances of Clostridium 
      cluster III and Fibrobacter spp. (≤ 0.1%), providing the first evidence that the 
      novel fibrobacters recently detected in landfill sites and other non-gut 
      environments colonize and degrade cellulose substrates in situ.

AB  - Lignin enhanced biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil, 
      but collaboration among soil microorganisms during this process remains poorly 
      understood. Here we explored the relations between microbial communities and PAH 
      transformation in soil microcosms amended with lignin. Mineralization of the 
      four-ring benzo(a)anthracene (BaA), which was selected as a model, was determined by 
      using an isotope-labeled tracer. The eukaryotic inhibitor cycloheximide and redox 
      mediator ABTS were used to validate the fungal role, while microbial communities 
      were monitored by amplicon sequencing. The results demonstrated that lignin 
      significantly promoted BaA mineralization to CO(2), which was inhibited and enhanced 
      by cycloheximide and ABTS, respectively. Together with the increased abundance of 
      Basidiomycota, these observations suggested an essential contribution of fungi to 
      BaA biodegradation, which possibly through a ligninolytic enzyme-mediated pathway. 
      The enrichment of Methylophilaceae and Sphingomonadaceae supported bacterial 
      utilization of methyl and aryl groups derived from lignin, implicating cometabolic 
      BaA degradation. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed increased interactions 
      between fungi and bacteria, suggesting they played synergistic roles in the 
      transformation of lignin and BaA. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the 
      importance of synergy between fungi and bacteria in PAH transformation, and further 
      suggest that the modulation of microbial interplay may ameliorate soil 
      bioremediation with natural materials such as lignin.

      Consortium TMC7.
PG  - 1123-1133
LID - 10.4014/jmb.2106.06015 [doi]
AB  - Biodegradation is the key process involved in natural lignocellulose 
      biotransformation and utilization. Microbial consortia represent promising 
      candidates for applications in lignocellulose conversion strategies for biofuel 
      production; however, cooperation among the enzymes and the labor division of 
      microbes in the microbial consortia remains unclear. In this study, metagenomic 
      analysis was performed to reveal the community structure and extremozyme systems of 
      a lignocellulolytic microbial consortium, TMC7. The taxonomic affiliation of TMC7 
      metagenome included members of the genera Ruminiclostridium (42.85%), 
      Thermoanaerobacterium (18.41%), Geobacillus (10.44%), unclassified_f__Bacillaceae 
      (7.48%), Aeribacillus (2.65%), Symbiobacterium (2.47%), Desulfotomaculum (2.33%), 
      Caldibacillus (1.56%), Clostridium (1.26%), and others (10.55%). The 
      carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation revealed that TMC7 encoded a broad array of 
      enzymes responsible for cellulose and hemicellulose degradation. Ten glycoside 
      hydrolases (GHs) endoglucanase, 4 GHs exoglucanase, and 6 GHs β-glucosidase were 
      identified for cellulose degradation; 6 GHs endo-β-1,4-xylanase, 9 GHs β-xylosidase, 
      and 3 GHs β-mannanase were identified for degradation of the hemicellulose main 
      chain; 6 GHs arabinofuranosidase, 2 GHs α-mannosidase, 11 GHs galactosidase, 3 GHs 
      α-rhamnosidase, and 4 GHs α-fucosidase were identified as xylan debranching enzymes. 
      Furthermore, by introducing a factor named as the contribution coefficient, we found 
      that Ruminiclostridium and Thermoanaerobacterium may be the dominant contributors, 
      whereas Symbiobacterium and Desulfotomaculum may serve as "sugar cheaters" in 
      lignocellulose degradation by TMC7. Our findings provide mechanistic profiles of an 
      array of enzymes that degrade complex lignocellulosic biomass in the microbial 
      consortium TMC7 and provide a promising approach for studying the potential 
      contribution of microbes in microbial consortia.

TI  - Screening and Comparison of Lignin Degradation Microbial Consortia from Wooden 
      Antiques.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26102862 [doi]
LID - 2862
AB  - Lignin, which is a component of wood, is difficult to degrade in nature. However, 
      serious decay caused by microbial consortia can happen to wooden antiques during the 
      preservation process. This study successfully screened four microbial consortia with 
      lignin degradation capabilities (J-1, J-6, J-8 and J-15) from decayed wooden 
      antiques. Their compositions were identified by genomic sequencing, while the 
      degradation products were analyzed by GC-MS. The lignin degradation efficiency of 
      J-6 reached 54% after 48 h with an initial lignin concentration of 0.5 g/L at pH 4 
      and rotation speed of 200 rpm. The fungal consortium of J-6 contained 
      Saccharomycetales (98.92%) and Ascomycota (0.56%), which accounted for 31% of the 
      total biomass. The main bacteria in J-6 were Shinella sp. (47.38%), Cupriavidus sp. 
      (29.84%), and Bosea sp. (7.96%). The strongest degradation performance of J-6 
      corresponded to its composition, where Saccharomycetales likely adapted to the 
      system and improved lignin degradation enzymes activities, and the abundant 
      bacterial consortium accelerated lignin decomposition. Our work demonstrated the 
      potential utilization of microbial consortia via the synergy of microbial consortia, 
      which may overcome the shortcomings of traditional lignin biodegradation when using 
      a single strain, and the potential use of J-6 for lignin degradation/removal 
      applications.

TI  - Roles of ompA of Citrobacter werkmanii in bacterial growth, biocide resistance, 
      biofilm formation and swimming motility.
PG  - 2841-2854
LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-11057-1 [doi]
AB  - The genus Citrobacter is commonly found in environmental and industrial settings, 
      some members of which have been used for bioremediation of heavy metals owing to the 
      absorption ability of their biofilms. Although our previous studies have found that 
      the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) contributes to the process of Citrobacter 
      werkmanii biofilm formation, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Therefore, we 
      deleted ompA from the genome of C. werkmanii and investigated its phenotypes in 
      comparison to the wild type strain (WT) and the complementary strain using 
      biochemical and molecular techniques including RNA-Seq. Our results demonstrated 
      that the deletion of ompA led to an increase in biofilm formation on both 
      polystyrene and glass surfaces due to upregulation of some biofilm formation related 
      genes. Meanwhile, swimming ability, which is mediated by activation of flagellar 
      assembly genes, was increased on semi-solid plates in the ∆ompA strain when compared 
      with WT. Additionally, inactivation of ompA also caused increased 
      1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT) resistance, differential responses to Ca(2+) 
      stress, curli protein expression and cellulose production. Finally, ∆ompA caused 
      differential expression of a total of 1470 genes when compared with WT, of which 146 
      were upregulated and 1324 were downregulated. These genes were classified into 
      different Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways. In summary, ompA in C. werkmanii 
      contributes to a variety of biological functions and may act as a target site to 
      modulate biofilm formation. KEY POINTS: • ompA is a negative regulator for biofilm 
      formation by C. werkmanii. • ompA inhibits swimming motility of C. werkmanii. • ompA 
      deletion causes different expression profiles in C. werkmanii.

AB  - The potential of the culturable bacterial community from an Alpine coniferous forest 
      site for the degradation of organic polymers and pollutants at low (5 °C) and 
      moderate (20 °C) temperatures was evaluated. The majority of the 68 strains belonged 
      to the phylum Proteobacteria (77%). Other strains were related to Bacteroidetes 
      (12%), Alphaproteobacteria (4%), Actinobacteria (3%), and Firmicutes (3%). The 
      strains were grouped into 42 different OTUs. The highest bacterial diversity was 
      found within the phylum Bacteroidetes. All strains, except one, could grow at 
      temperatures from 5 to 25 °C. The production of enzyme activities involved in the 
      degradation of organic polymers present in plant litter (carboxymethyl cellulose, 
      microgranular cellulose, xylan, polygalacturonic acid) was almost comparable at 5 °C 
      (68%) and 20 °C (63%). Utilizers of lignin compounds (lignosulfonic acid, lignin 
      alkali) as sole carbon source were found to a higher extent at 20 °C (57%) than at 5 
      °C (24%), but the relative fractions among positively tested strains utilizing these 
      compounds were almost identical at the two temperatures. Similar results were noted 
      for utilizers of organic pollutants (n-hexadecane, diesel oil, phenol, glyphosate) 
      as sole carbon source. More than two-thirds showed constitutively expressed 
      catechol-1,2-dioxygenase activity both at 5 °C (74%) and 20 °C (66%). Complete 
      phenol (2.5 mmol/L) degradation by strain Paraburkholderia aromaticivorans AR20-38 
      was demonstrated at 0-30 °C, amounts up to 7.5 mmol/L phenol were fully degraded at 
      10-30 °C. These results are useful to better understand the effect of changing 
      temperatures on microorganisms involved in litter degradation and nutrient turnover 
      in Alpine forest soils.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The production of agricultural wastes still growing as a consequence of 
      the population growing. However, the majority of these residues are under-utilized 
      due their chemical composition, which is mainly composed by cellulose. Actually, the 
      search of cellulases with high efficiency to degrade this carbohydrate remains as 
      the challenge. In the present experiment, two genes encoding an endoglucanase (EC 
      3.2.1.4) and β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and 
      their recombinant enzymes (egl-FZYE and cel-FZYE, respectively) characterized. Those 
      genes were found in Trabulsiella odontermitis which was isolated from the gut of 
      termite Heterotermes sp. Additionally, the capability to release sugars from 
      agricultural wastes was evaluated in both enzymes, alone and in combination. 
      RESULTS: The results have shown that optimal pH was 6.0 and 6.5, reaching an 
      activity of 1051.65 ± 47.78 and 607.80 ± 10.19 U/mg at 39 °C, for egl-FZYE and 
      cel-FZYE, respectively. The Km and Vmax for egl-FZYE using CMC as substrate were 
      11.25 mg/mL and 3921.57 U/mg, respectively, whereas using Avicel were 15.39 mg/mL 
      and 2314.81 U/mg, respectively. The Km and Vmax for cel-FZYE using Avicel as 
      substrate were 11.49 mg/mL and 2105.26 U/mg, respectively, whereas using CMC the 
      enzyme did not had activity. Both enzymes had effect on agricultural wastes, and 
      their effect was improved when they were combined reaching an activity of 
      955.1 ± 116.1, 4016.8 ± 332 and 1124.2 ± 241 U/mg on corn stover, sorghum stover and 
      pine sawdust, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both enzymes were capable of degrading 
      agricultural wastes, and their effectiveness was improved up to 60% of glucose 
      released when combined. In summary, the results of the study demonstrate that the 
      recombinant enzymes exhibit characteristics that indicate their value as potential 
      feed additives and that the enzymes could be used to enhance the degradation of 
      cellulose in the poor-quality forage generally used in ruminant feedstuffs.

TI  - Cell-surface exposure of a hybrid 3-cohesin scaffoldin allowing the 
      functionalization of Escherichia coli envelope.
PG  - 626-636
LID - 10.1002/bit.27242 [doi]
AB  - Cellulosomes are large plant cell wall degrading complexes secreted by some 
      anaerobic bacteria. They are typically composed of a major scaffolding protein 
      containing multiple receptors called cohesins, which tightly anchor a small 
      complementary module termed dockerin harbored by the cellulosomal enzymes. In the 
      present study, we have successfully cell surface exposed in Escherichia coli a 
      hybrid scaffoldin, Scaf6, fused to the curli protein CsgA, the latter is known to 
      polymerize at the surface of E. coli to form extracellular fibers under stressful 
      environmental conditions. The C-terminal part of the chimera encompasses the hybrid 
      scaffoldin composed of three cohesins from different bacterial origins and a 
      carbohydrate-binding module targeting insoluble cellulose. Using three cellulases 
      hosting the complementary dockerin modules and labeled with different fluorophores, 
      we have shown that the hybrid scaffoldin merged to CsgA is massively exposed at the 
      cell surface of E. coli and that each cohesin module is fully operational. 
      Altogether these data open a new route for a series of biotechnological applications 
      exploiting the cell-surface exposure of CsgA-Scaf6 in various industrial sectors 
      such as vaccines, biocatalysts or bioremediation, simply by grafting the small 
      dockerin module to the desired proteins before incubation with the engineered E. 
      coli.

      valorization of lignin.
PG  - 25771-25778
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1916349117 [doi]
AB  - Cytochrome P450 enzymes have tremendous potential as industrial biocatalysts, 
      including in biological lignin valorization. Here, we describe P450s that catalyze 
      the O-demethylation of lignin-derived guaiacols with different ring substitution 
      patterns. Bacterial strains Rhodococcus rhodochrous EP4 and Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 
      both utilized alkylguaiacols as sole growth substrates. Transcriptomics of EP4 grown 
      on 4-propylguaiacol (4PG) revealed the up-regulation of agcA, encoding a CYP255A1 
      family P450, and the aph genes, previously shown to encode a meta-cleavage pathway 
      responsible for 4-alkylphenol catabolism. The function of the homologous pathway in 
      RHA1 was confirmed: Deletion mutants of agcA and aphC, encoding the meta-cleavage 
      alkylcatechol dioxygenase, grew on guaiacol but not 4PG. By contrast, deletion 
      mutants of gcoA and pcaL, encoding a CYP255A2 family P450 and an ortho-cleavage 
      pathway enzyme, respectively, grew on 4-propylguaiacol but not guaiacol. CYP255A1 
      from EP4 catalyzed the O-demethylation of 4-alkylguaiacols to 4-alkylcatechols with 
      the following apparent specificities (k (cat)/K (M)): propyl > ethyl > methyl > 
      guaiacol. This order largely reflected AgcA's binding affinities for the different 
      guaiacols and was the inverse of GcoA(EP4)'s specificities. The biocatalytic 
      potential of AgcA was demonstrated by the ability of EP4 to grow on lignin-derived 
      products obtained from the reductive catalytic fractionation of corn stover, 
      depleting alkylguaiacols and alkylphenols. By identifying related P450s with 
      complementary specificities for lignin-relevant guaiacols, this study facilitates 
      the design of these enzymes for biocatalytic applications. We further demonstrated 
      that the metabolic fate of the guaiacol depends on its substitution pattern, a 
      finding that has significant implications for engineering biocatalysts to valorize 
      lignin.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of thermal pretreatment (TP) on the 
      lignocellulose degradation and humification during dairy manure composting and the 
      underlying microbial mechanism. The results showed that TP accelerated temperature 
      rise and elevated composting temperature by increasing 26% initial content of simple 
      organics. The degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin was 78, 10 and 109% 
      higher in thermal pretreatment composting (TPC) than traditional composting (TC), 
      respectively. Moreover, TP significantly improved the humification degree of 
      composts, as indicated by 14 and 38% higher humus content and humification indexes 
      in TPC, respectively. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TP increased the relative 
      abundance of thermophilic bacteria in TPC, of which Thermobifida, Planifilum, 
      Truepera and Thermomonospora were potentially involved in lignocellulose 
      biodegradation and humification. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that TP 
      changed the main factor determining the bacterial community evolution from dissolved 
      organic carbon (DOC) in TC to temperature in TPC.

AB  - Gravel-based subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (CWs) amended with a walnut shell 
      (WS) substrate were established to treat synthetic acid mine drainage (AMD) in this 
      study, and artificial domestic wastewater (DW) and plant litter broth (PLB) were 
      supplemented to enhance the performance. The CW media rapidly reached adsorption 
      saturation with respect to metals (except Fe and Cr) without an external carbon 
      source, while the addition of DW and PLB stimulated sulfate reduction activity and 
      achieved efficient biogenic metal removal, primarily by the formation of hydroxide 
      and sulfide precipitates and concomitant co-precipitation. The WS-amended CWs 
      performed notably better than the control systems, not only in sequestering more 
      metals and rapidly establishing favourable environments for biogenic metal abatement 
      but also in supporting better growth of plants and functional microbes. The external 
      organic carbon input greatly shaped the bacterial community compositions in the CWs, 
      with substantial increases in the proportions of core functional populations 
      involved in AMD biotreatment. Cooperation among Cellulomonas, Propioniciclava and 
      sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), dominated by Desulfobulbus and Desulfatirhabdium, 
      was the primary biogenic mechanism of AMD remediation in the CWs. Cellulosic 
      waste-amended CWs with DW and PLB addition offer a promising eco-technology for AMD 
      remediation.

AB  - Ligninolytic bacteria degrading lignin were isolates and identified, and their 
      biodegradation mechanism of alkaline-lignin was investigated. Four strains with 
      lignin degradation capability were screened and identified from the soil, straw, and 
      silage based on their decolorizing capacity of aniline blue and colony size on 
      alkaline-lignin medium. The degradation ratio of Bacillus aryabhattai BY5, 
      Acinetobacter johnsonii LN2, Acinetobacter lwoffii LN4, and Micrococcus yunnanensis 
      CL32 have been assayed using alkaline-lignin as the unique carbon source. Further, 
      the Lip (lignin peroxidase) and Mnp (manganese peroxidase) activities of strains 
      were investigated. Lip activity of A. lwoffii LN4 was highest after 72 h of 
      incubation and reached 7151.7 U · l(-1). Mnp activity of M. yunnanensis CL32 was 
      highest after 48 h and reached 12533 U · l(-1). The analysis of alkaline-lignin 
      degradation products by GC-MS revealed that the strains screened could utilize 
      aromatic esters compounds such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and decomposite 
      monocyclic aromatic compounds through the DBP aerobic metabolic pathway. The results 
      indicate that B. aryabhattai BY5, A. johnsonii LN2, A. lwoffii LN4, and M. 
      yunnanensis CL32 have high potential to degrade alkaline-lignin, and might utilize 
      aromatic compounds by DBP aerobic metabolic pathway in the process of lignin 
      degradation.

AB  - The mechanisms associated with the biomethane metabolism through the synergistic 
      biodegradation of both coal and corn straw were explored to improve the utilization 
      rate of corn straw. This applies to the filling of the goaf with corn straw and the 
      production of biomethane using indigenous bacteria in the mine water with coal. The 
      results showed that new macromolecular substances (e.g., Tetracosane and 
      Pentacosane) were produced on the third day. A lower coal rank leads to a lower 
      biodegradation rate of low-molecular-weight substances (e.g., butyric acid and 
      valeric acid). Under the addition of coal samples, the biodegradation rate of 
      cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in corn straw could reached up to 29.82%, 35.79% 
      and 6.16%, respectively. The addition of corn straw promoted the complementary 
      advantages of archaeal genera (such as Methanosarina and Methanospirillum) and 
      decreased the adverse bacterial genera (such as Desulfovibrio and Pseudomonas) in 
      the fermentation system of single coal.

TI  - Microbial decomposition of post-harvest sugarcane residue.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - A laboratory in situ composting study was conducted as a possible alternative method 
      for the current practice of open air burning of post-harvest sugarcane residue by 
      sugarcane farmers. In situ composting of the sugarcane residue by the indigenous 
      bacteria and fungi was accelerated using molasses as an initial substrate. A 
      one-time application of molasses boosted the soil microbial population. which 
      started to decompose the ligno-cellulosic fractions of the residue. The study showed 
      significant differences in several parameters among the control and molasses applied 
      treatments, namely, visual decomposition of residue, bacterial and fungal 
      population, soil pH, cellulose content, cellulase activity. and soil organic matter. 
      Further study is needed to refine the process for the future application of this 
      technology as a possible alternative to the current practice of open air burning of 
      sugarcane residue by farmers.

AB  - The aerobic biodegradation of common textiles that shed microfibers during 
      laundering was evaluated under the action of microbes found in the environment, such 
      as lake and seawater, and activated sludge at a low concentration from a wastewater 
      treatment plant (WWTP). Under these conditions, the biodegradation potential was the 
      same in all the experiments: Microcrystalline Cellulose 
      (MCC) > Cotton > Rayon > Polyester/Cotton ≫ Polyester. Nevertheless, for cotton and 
      rayon yarns, >70% biodegradation was achieved with activated sludge at low 
      concentration and lake water, whereas in seawater, about 50% degradation was 
      reached. Polyester did not appreciably degrade. The biodegradation results herein 
      indicate potential not absolutes in nature. The bacterial diversity analyses in the 
      different biodegradation inoculums show that there are distinct bacterial 
      communities related to the assimilation and mineralization of complex carbohydrates 
      that were promoted with the cellulosic MCC, cotton, and rayon samples different than 
      the polyester sample.

AB  - The increasing water crisis makes fresh water a valuable resource, which must be 
      used wisely. However, with growing population and inefficient waste treatment 
      systems, the amount of wastewater dispelled in rivers is increasing abominably. 
      Utilizing this freely available waste-water along with biodiesel industry waste- 
      crude glycerol for bio-hydrogen production is being reported here. The bacterial 
      cultures of Bacillus thuringiensis strain EGU45 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 
      strain CD16 produced2.4-3.0 L H2/day/L feed during a 60 days continuous culture 
      system at hydraulic retention time of 2 days. An average H2 yield of 100-120 L/L CG 
      was reported by the two strains. Recycling of the effluent by up to 25% resulted in 
      up to 94% H2 production compared to control.

AB  - Two stable, thermophilic mixed cellulolytic consortia were enriched from an 
      industrial scale biogas fermenter. The two consortia, marked as AD1 and AD2, were 
      used for bioaugmentation in laboratory scale batch reactors. They enhanced the 
      methane yield by 22-24%. Next generation sequencing method revealed the main orders 
      being Thermoanaerobacterales and Clostridiales and the predominant strains were 
      Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, Caldanaerobacter subterraneus, 
      Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus and Clostridium cellulolyticum. The effect of 
      these strains, cultivated in pure cultures, was investigated with the aim of 
      reconstructing the defined cellulolytic consortium. The addition of the four 
      bacterial strains and their mixture to the biogas fermenters enhanced the methane 
      yield by 10-11% but it was not as efficient as the original communities indicating 
      the significant contribution by members of the enriched communities present in low 
      abundance.

TI  - A Novel Gene Cluster Is Involved in the Degradation of Lignin-Derived Monoaromatics 
      in Thermus oshimai JL-2.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01589-20 [doi]
LID - e01589-20
AB  - A novel gene cluster involved in the degradation of lignin-derived monoaromatics 
      such as p-hydroxybenzoate, vanillate, and ferulate has been identified in the 
      thermophilic nitrate reducer Thermus oshimai JL-2. Based on conserved domain 
      analyses and metabolic pathway mapping, the cluster was classified into upper- and 
      peripheral-pathway operons. The upper-pathway genes, responsible for the degradation 
      of p-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate, are located on a 0.27-Mb plasmid, whereas the 
      peripheral-pathway genes, responsible for the transformation of ferulate, are spread 
      throughout the plasmid and the chromosome. In addition, a lower-pathway operon was 
      also identified in the plasmid that corresponds to the meta-cleavage pathway of 
      catechol. Spectrophotometric and gene induction data suggest that the upper and 
      lower operons are induced by p-hydroxybenzoate, which the strain can degrade 
      completely within 4 days of incubation, whereas the peripheral genes are expressed 
      constitutively. The upper degradation pathway follows a less common route, 
      proceeding via the decarboxylation of protocatechuate to form catechol, and involves 
      a novel thermostable γ-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase homolog, identified as 
      protocatechuate decarboxylase based on gene deletion experiments. This gene cluster 
      is conserved in only a few members of the Thermales and shows traces of vertical 
      expansion of catabolic pathways in these organisms toward lignoaromatics.IMPORTANCE 
      High-temperature steam treatment of lignocellulosic biomass during the extraction of 
      cellulose and hemicellulose fractions leads to the release of a wide array of 
      lignin-derived aromatics into the natural ecosystem, some of which can have 
      detrimental effects on the environment. Not only will identifying organisms capable 
      of using such aromatics aid in environmental cleanup, but thermostable enzymes, if 
      characterized, can also be used for efficient lignin valorization. However, no 
      thermophilic lignin degraders have been reported thus far. The present study reports 
      T. oshimai JL-2 as a thermophilic bacterium with the potential to use lignin-derived 
      aromatics. The identification of a novel thermostable protocatechuate decarboxylase 
      gene in the strain further adds to its significance, as such an enzyme can be 
      efficiently used in the biosynthesis of cis,cis-muconate, an important intermediate 
      in the commercial production of plastics.

AB  - Contamination of steroidal estrogens in the environment has raised a great public 
      concern, and therefore, developing an effective method for removal of trace amount 
      of environmental estrogens is necessary. In this study, two estrogen-degrading 
      bacteria were isolated from activated sludge and were identified as strain 
      Sphingomonas sp. AHC-F and strain Sphingobium sp. AX-B. They were capable of 
      utilizing estrone (E1) and 17ß-estradiol (E2) as sole carbon and energy source. Cell 
      immobilization technique was applied to these two estrogen-degrading bacteria. 
      Confocal laser-scanning microscopy images with live and dead staining of entrapped 
      bacterial cells showed that most bacteria were present inside the porous structure 
      and were mostly viable after immobilization procedures. Batch estrogen degradation 
      study showed that immobilized strains AHC-F and AX-B could effectively degrade 2 
      mg/L of E2 and its metabolite E1. Immobilized bacteria column reactors using pure 
      culture of strain AHC-F were set up for continuous-flow removal of 850 ng/L of E2 in 
      the influent. The removal efficiency of E2 and equivalent estrogenic quantity of E2 
      (EEQ) could achieve 94 and 87% under 12 h hydraulic retention time (HRT), 
      respectively. Increasing HRT could further improve the removal efficiency of EEQ. 
      When the HRT increased to 72 h, the effluent concentrations of E2 and E1 were not 
      detectable by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our results also proved that 
      most of the estrogen removal was due to biodegradation. This study has demonstrated 
      the potential use of immobilized bacteria technique for the removal of environmental 
      estrogens.

AB  - This study is one of the few investigations which analyze albumen prints, perhaps 
      the most important photographic heritage of the late 19(th) and early 20(th) 
      centuries. The chemical composition of photographic samples was assessed using 
      Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence. These two 
      non-invasive techniques revealed the complex nature of albumen prints, which are 
      composed of a mixture of proteins, cellulose and salts. Microbial sampling was 
      performed using cellulose nitrate membranes which also permitted the trapped 
      microflora to be observed with a scanning electron microscope. Microbial analysis 
      was performed using the combination of culture-dependent (cultivation in different 
      media, including one 3% NaCl) and culture-independent (bacterial and fungal cloning 
      and sequencing) approaches. The isolated microorganisms were screened for their 
      lipolytic, proteolytic, cellulolytic, catalase and peroxidase activities. The 
      combination of the culture-dependent and -independent techniques together with 
      enzymatic assays revealed a substantial microbial diversity with several deteriogen 
      microorganisms from the genera Bacillus, Kocuria, Streptomyces and Geobacillus and 
      the fungal strains Acrostalagmus luteoalbus, Bjerkandera adusta, Pleurotus 
      pulmonarius and Trichothecium roseum.

AB  - Generation of insects' biomass from lignocellulose rich organic wastes is of 
      significant challenges in reducing the environmental impact of wastes and in 
      sustaining feed and food security. This research looked at the effects of 
      lignocellulotic exogenous bacteria in the black soldier fly (BSF) organic waste 
      conversion system for biomass production and lignocellulose biodegradation of dairy 
      and chicken manures. Six exogenous bacteria were investigated for cellulolytic 
      activity with carboxymethyl cellulose and found that these tested bacterial strains 
      degrade the cellulose. In this study; a co-conversion process using Hermetia 
      illucens larvae to convert the previously studied best mixing ratio of dairy manure 
      (DM) and chicken manure (CHM) (2:3) and cellulose degrading bacteria was established 
      to enhance the larval biomass production, waste reduction and manure nutrient 
      degradation. BSF larvae assisted by MRO(2) (R(5)) has the best outcome measures: 
      survival rate (99.1%), development time (19.0 d), manure reduction rate (48.7%), 
      bioconversion rate (10.8%), food conversion ratio (4.5), efficiency of conversion of 
      ingestion (22.3), cellulose (72.9%), hemicellulose (68.5%), lignin (32.8%), and 
      nutrient utilization (protein, 71.2% and fat, 67.8%). By analyzing the fiber 
      structural changes by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transformed infrared 
      spectroscopy (FT-IR), we assume that exogenous bacteria assist the BSF larvae that 
      trigger lead to structural and chemical modification of fibers. We hypothesized that 
      these surface and textural changes are beneficial to the associated gut bacteria, 
      thereby helping to larval growth and reduce waste. The finding of the investigation 
      showed that enhanced conversion of DM and CHM by BSF larvae assisted with 
      lignocellulotic exogenous bacteria could play key role in the manure management.

TI  - Biological treatments affect the chemical composition of coffee pulp.
PG  - 267-74
AB  - Biological treatments were applied to fresh coffee pulp (CoP) to improve its 
      nutritive value for monogastric animals by reducing its content of cellulose and 
      antinutritional factors (ANFs) such as total phenols, tannins and caffeine. 
      Treatments were: (1) ensiling with 0, 50 and 100 gkg(-1) molasses for 2 and 3 
      months, (2) aerobic decomposition for 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days, (3) aerobic 
      bacterial inoculation (Bacillus sp.) for 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Ensiled CoP 
      (E-CoP) showed higher fat and ash contents than oven-dried-CoP (OD-CoP; P<0.05). 
      Similarly, true protein values tended to increase. The cellulose and total phenols 
      levels of E-CoP were lower than OD-CoP (P<0.05). The E-CoP tannins levels tended to 
      be lower than OD-CoP whereas caffeine levels remained unaffected. Improvement in the 
      nutritional quality of E-CoP was associated with higher fat and protein contents and 
      reduction of cellulose, total phenols and tannins. The aerobic decomposition 
      treatment improved the nutritional quality of CoP by increasing true protein and fat 
      contents. In addition, total phenols, tannins, caffeine and cellulose contents were 
      reduced by an increase in treatment time (P<0.05). Bacterial treatment increased the 
      protein content of CoP after 21 days (from 137 to 392 gkg(-1)) and decreased it 
      after 28 days. Cellulose, total phenols, tannins and caffeine contents reduced with 
      an increase in time of bacterial degradation. Bacterial treatment improved the CoP 
      quality by increasing protein content and reducing cellulose and ANFs, especially 
      after 21 days of treatment. Both the aerobic decomposition (after 21-28 days) and 
      the aerobic bacterial degradation of CoP (after 21 days) appeared more suitable to 
      improve the nutritional quality of CoP than the ensiling.

TI  - Basic and applied aspects in the microbial degradation of azo dyes.
PG  - 69-80
AB  - Azo dyes are the most important group of synthetic colorants. They are generally 
      considered as xenobiotic compounds that are very recalcitrant against biodegradative 
      processes. Nevertheless, during the last few years it has been demonstrated that 
      several microorganisms are able, under certain environmental conditions, to 
      transform azo dyes to non-colored products or even to completely mineralize them. 
      Thus, various lignolytic fungi were shown to decolorize azo dyes using ligninases, 
      manganese peroxidases or laccases. For some model dyes, the degradative pathways 
      have been investigated and a true mineralization to carbon dioxide has been shown. 
      The bacterial metabolism of azo dyes is initiated in most cases by a reductive 
      cleavage of the azo bond, which results in the formation of (usually colorless) 
      amines. These reductive processes have been described for some aerobic bacteria, 
      which can grow with (rather simple) azo compounds. These specifically adapted 
      microorganisms synthesize true azoreductases, which reductively cleave the azo group 
      in the presence of molecular oxygen. Much more common is the reductive cleavage of 
      azo dyes under anaerobic conditions. These reactions usually occur with rather low 
      specific activities but are extremely unspecific with regard to the organisms 
      involved and the dyes converted. In these unspecific anaerobic processes, 
      low-molecular weight redox mediators (e.g. flavins or quinones) which are 
      enzymatically reduced by the cells (or chemically by bulk reductants in the 
      environment) are very often involved. These reduced mediator compounds reduce the 
      azo group in a purely chemical reaction. The (sulfonated) amines that are formed in 
      the course of these reactions may be degraded aerobically. Therefore, several 
      (laboratory-scale) continuous anaerobic/aerobic processes for the treatment of 
      wastewaters containing azo dyes have recently been described.

TI  - Ruminococcus albus 8 mutants defective in cellulose degradation are deficient in two 
      processive endocellulases, Cel48A and Cel9B, both of which possess a novel modular 
      architecture.
PG  - 136-45
AB  - The cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus albus 8 adheres tightly to cellulose, but 
      the molecular biology underpinning this process is not well characterized. 
      Subtractive enrichment procedures were used to isolate mutants of R. albus 8 that 
      are defective in adhesion to cellulose. Adhesion of the mutant strains was reduced 
      50% compared to that observed with the wild-type strain, and cellulose 
      solubilization was also shown to be slower in these mutant strains, suggesting that 
      bacterial adhesion and cellulose solubilization are inextricably linked. 
      Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that all three mutants 
      studied were impaired in the production of two high-molecular-mass, cell-bound 
      polypeptides when they were cultured with either cellobiose or cellulose. The 
      identities of these proteins were determined by a combination of mass spectrometry 
      methods and genome sequence data for R. albus 8. One of the polypeptides is a family 
      9 glycoside hydrolase (Cel9B), and the other is a family 48 glycoside hydrolase 
      (Cel48A). Both Cel9B and Cel48A possess a modular architecture, Cel9B possesses 
      features characteristic of the B(2) (or theme D) group of family 9 glycoside 
      hydrolases, and Cel48A is structurally similar to the processive endocellulases CelF 
      and CelS from Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum, respectively. 
      Both Cel9B and Cel48A could be recovered by cellulose affinity procedures, but 
      neither Cel9B nor Cel48A contains a dockerin, suggesting that these polypeptides are 
      retained on the bacterial cell surface, and recovery by cellulose affinity 
      procedures did not involve a clostridium-like cellulosome complex. Instead, both 
      proteins possess a single copy of a novel X module with an unknown function at the C 
      terminus. Such X modules are also present in several other R. albus glycoside 
      hydrolases and are phylogentically distinct from the fibronectin III-like and X 
      modules identified so far in other cellulolytic bacteria.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to characterize development of bacterial and 
      archaeal populations during biodegradation of municipal solid waste (MSW) and to 
      link specific methanogens to methane generation. Experiments were conducted in three 
      0.61-m-diameter by 0.90-m-tall laboratory reactors to simulate MSW bioreactor 
      landfills. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes was used to characterize microbial 
      communities in both leachate and solid waste. Microbial assemblages in effluent 
      leachate were similar between reactors during peak methane generation. Specific 
      groups within the Bacteroidetes and Thermatogae phyla were present in all samples 
      and were particularly abundant during peak methane generation. Microbial communities 
      were not similar in leachate and solid fractions assayed at the end of reactor 
      operation; solid waste contained a more abundant bacterial community of 
      cellulose-degrading organisms (e.g., Firmicutes). Specific methanogen populations 
      were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Methanomicrobiales, 
      Methanosarcinaceae, and Methanobacteriales were the predominant methanogens in all 
      reactors, with Methanomicrobiales consistently the most abundant. Methanogen growth 
      phases coincided with accelerated methane production, and cumulative methane yield 
      increased with increasing total methanogen abundance. The difference in methanogen 
      populations and corresponding methane yield is attributed to different initial 
      cellulose and hemicellulose contents of the MSW. Higher initial cellulose and 
      hemicellulose contents supported growth of larger methanogen populations that 
      resulted in higher methane yield.

TI  - Probing active microbes involved in Bt-containing rice straw decomposition.
PG  - 10273-10284

AB  - Transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice extends significant protection against 
      insect pests and meets the increasing demands for food and energy. Many studies have 
      been conducted investigating the impacts of Bt rice to the agricultural ecosystem, 
      but much less attention has been given to efforts attempting to determine how the 
      presence of Bt rice influences and shapes the microbial community, especially the 
      active microbes. Stable isotope probing and high-throughput sequencing were employed 
      to explore the active microbes involved in Bt-containing straw decomposition. 
      Compared to its near isoline, the Bt straw contained higher contents of total N, 
      total P, total K, lignin, cellulose, and Cry1Ab toxin protein. These chemical 
      differences did not affect the decomposition rate but significantly changed the 
      active microbial decomposer communities. During the decomposition of Bt-containing 
      straw, fungi were more affected than bacteria. Agromyces, Terrabacter, 
      Microbacterium, Glycomyces, and Kribbella were the most representative unique 
      (existed only in the Bt treatments and appeared at the early stage) bacterial 
      genera, and Trichoderma was the most representative unique fungal genus in the Bt 
      straw decomposition. By using similarity index calculation and function prediction, 
      the significant differences between Bt straw and non-Bt straw treatments were found 
      to be transient for both microbial taxa and functional traits. These results 
      suggested that Bt rice has a significant but transient impact on soil microbes in 
      terms of microbial straw decomposition.

AB  - Using tobacco straw (Ts) and lignin as the sole carbon source, a strain was isolated 
      from Ts and identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SL-7 by 16S rDNA 
      gene-sequencing technology.7-day incubation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SL-7 can 
      reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) by 69.35% in lignin mineral salt medium. The 
      activity of Manganese peroxidase (MnP) reached maximum level 258.57 U L(-1), and 
      Lignin peroxidase (Lip) was 422.68 U L(-1) at 4th day. The highest Laccase (Lac) 
      activity (55.95 U L(-1)) was observed at 3th day. After straw-liquid fermentation 
      degradation of 15 days, the bacterial could degrade 28.55% lignin of the straw which 
      was close to that of fungi. Compared with the control group and effective 
      microorganisms (EM) group, the lignin degradation rate in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 
      SL-7 group increased by 22.26% and 11.70% at 41-day compost fermentation of tobacco 
      straw. These show the strain has strong lignin degradation performance.

AB  - Bacterial biofilm plays a pivotal role in bioremediation of heavy metals from 
      wastewaters. In this study, we isolated and identified different biofilm producing 
      bacteria from wastewaters. We also characterized the biofilm matrix [i.e., 
      extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)] produced by different bacteria. Out of 40 
      isolates from different wastewaters, only 11 (27.5%) isolates (static condition at 
      28°C) and 9 (22.5%) isolates (agitate and static conditions at 28 and 37°C) produced 
      air-liquid (AL) and solid-air-liquid (SAL) biofilms, respectively, only on 
      salt-optimized broth plus 2% glycerol (SOBG) but not in other media tested. Biomass 
      biofilms and bacteria coupled with AL biofilms were significantly (P ≤ 0.001) varied 
      in these isolates. Escherichia coli (isolate ENSD101 and ENST501), Enterobacter 
      asburiae (ENSD102), Enterobacter ludwigii (ENSH201), Pseudomonas fluorescens 
      (ENSH202 and ENSG304), uncultured Vitreoscilla sp. (ENSG301 and ENSG305), 
      Acinetobacter lwoffii (ENSG302), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ENSG303), and Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (ENSW401) were identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Scanning 
      electron microscope (SEM) images revealed that biofilm matrix produced by E. 
      asburiae ENSD102, uncultured Vitreoscilla sp. ENSG301, A. lwoffii ENSG302, and K. 
      pneumoniae ENSG303 are highly fibrous, compact, and nicely interlinked as compared 
      to the biofilm developed by E. ludwigii ENSH201 and B. thuringiensis ENSW401. X-ray 
      diffraction (XRD) results indicated that biofilm matrix produced by E. asburiae 
      ENSD102, uncultured Vitreoscilla sp. ENSG301, and A. lwoffii ENSG302 are 
      non-crystalline amorphous nature. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy 
      showed that proteins and polysaccharides are the main components of the biofilms. 
      Congo red binding results suggested that all these bacteria produced proteinaceous 
      curli fimbriae and cellulose-rich polysaccharide. Production of cellulose was also 
      confirmed by Calcofluor binding- and spectrophotometric assays. E. asburiae ENSD102, 
      Vitreoscilla sp. ENSG301, and A. lwoffii ENSG302 were tested for their abilities to 
      form the biofilms exposure to 0 to 2000 mg/L of copper sulfate (for Cu), zinc 
      sulfate (for Zn), lead nitrate (for Pb), nickel chloride (for Ni), and potassium 
      dichromate (for Cr), several concentrations of these metals activated the biofilm 
      formation. The polysaccharides is known to sequester the heavy metals thus, these 
      bacteria might be applied to remove the heavy metals from wastewater.

TI  - Biodegradation of polyether-polyol-based polyurethane elastomeric films: influence 
      of partial replacement of polyether polyol by biopolymers of renewable origin.
PG  - 1043-52
AB  - In this work we investigated the degradation process ofpolyether-polyol-based 
      polyurethane (PUR) elastomeric films in the presence of a mixed thermophilic culture 
      as a model of a natural bacterial consortium. The presence of PUR material in 
      cultivation medium resulted in delayed but intensive growth of the bacterial 
      culture. The unusually long lag phase was caused by the release of unreacted 
      polyether polyol and tin catalyst from the material. The lag phase was significantly 
      shortened and the biodegradability of PUR materials was enhanced by partial 
      replacement (10%) of polyether polyol with biopolymers (carboxymethyl cellulose, 
      hydroxyethyl cellulose, acetyl cellulose and actylated starch). The process of 
      material degradation consisted of two steps. First, the materials were mechanically 
      disrupted and, second, the bacterial culture was able to utilize abiotic degradation 
      products, which resulted in supported bacterial growth. Direct utilization of PUR by 
      the bacterial culture was observed as well, but the bacterial culture contributed 
      only slightly to the total mass losses. The only exception was PUR material modified 
      by acetyl cellulose. In this case, direct biodegradation represented the major 
      mechanism of material decomposition. Moreover, PUR material modified by acetyl 
      cellulose did not tend to undergo abiotic degradation. In conclusion, the 
      modification of PUR by proper biopolymers is a promising strategy for reducing 
      potential negative effects of waste PUR materials on the environment and enhancing

TI  - [Lignocellulose degrading bacteria and their genes encoding cellulase/hemicellulase 
      in rumen--a review].
PG  - 981-7
AB  - Rumen of ruminant animals is known as a natural reactor involved in highly efficient 
      lignocelluloses degradation. Rumen fibrolytic microbes have attracted an increasing 
      attention for their potential value in biofuel research. Studies on rumen microbes 
      have traditionally entailed the isolation of fibrolytic bacteria and subsequent 
      analysis of fibrolytic enzymes. Developments in genomic and metagenomic approaches 
      have made it possible to isolate directly genes and gene clusters encoding 
      fibrolytic activities from rumen samples, permitting a global analysis of mechanisms 
      of degradation of lignocellulose in rumen. Research in this field shows that 
      lignocellulose degradation in rumen is a complex process involving a number of 
      different microbes and is effected by a huge array of hydrolytic enzymes in a 
      concerted fashion. This review briefly summarizes results from recent studies, 
      especially metagenomic studies, on lignocellulose degradation in rumen.

TI  - [Recent advances in Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 for lignin aromatic compounds 
      degradation--a review].
PG  - 854-67
AB  - Lignin is complex heteropolymer produced from hydroxycinnamyl alcohols through 
      radical coupling. In nature, white-rot fungi are assumed initially to attack native 
      lignin and release lignin-derived-low-molecular-weight compounds, and soil bacteria 
      play an importent role for completely degradation of these compounds. Study on the 
      soil bacteria degrading lignin-derived-low-molecular-weight compounds will give way 
      to understand how aromatic compounds recycle in nature, and to utilize lignin 
      compounds as the renewable materials for valuable materials production. Sphingobium 
      sp. SYK-6 that grows on lignin biphenyl (5,5'-dehydrodivanillate) had been isolated 
      from pulp effluent in 1987. We have researched this bacterium more than 25 years, a 
      serious aromatic metabolic pathway has been determined, and related genes have been 
      isolated. As the complete genome sequence of SYK-6 has been opened to the public in 
      2012, the entire aromatic compounds degradation mechanisms become more clear. Main 
      contents in our review cover: (1) genome information; (2) aryl metabolism; (3) 
      biphenyl metabolism; (4) ferulate metabolism; (5) tetrahydrofolate-dependent 
      O-demethylation system for lignin compound degrdation; (6) protocatechuate 
      4,5-cleavage pathway; (7) multiple pathways for 3-O-methylgallate metabolism.

LID - 10.1080/10934529.2011.586246 [doi]
AB  - This research investigated the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of bisphenol-A 
      (BPA) in river sediment. With the addition of 250 μg g⁻¹ BPA, the percentages of BPA 
      remaining in sediment from sites A, B, and C were 21.9 %, 3.5 % and 12.5 %, 
      respectively, after 5 days of incubation under aerobic conditions; degradation was 
      not significant after 140 days of incubation under anaerobic conditions. The aerobic 
      degradation of BPA was enhanced by adding yeast extract (5 mg L⁻¹), sodium chloride 
      (1 %), cellulose (0.96 mg L⁻¹), brij 30 (55 μM), brij 35 (91 μM), rhamnolipid (130 
      mg L⁻¹), or surfactin (43 mg L⁻¹), with rhamnolipid yielding higher BPA degradation 
      than the other additives. 2,4-bis (1,1-dimethyl ethyl) phenol, an intermediate 
      product resulting from the aerobic degradation of BPA was accumulated in sediments. 
      Of the bacterial strains isolated from the sediment, strains J1, J2, J3, and J4 
      expressed the best aerobic degrading ability. The highest BPA degradation rate was 
      found in the sediment by the addition of strains J1, J2, J3, and J4 combined, 
      whereas the sediment without the addition of the 4 strains had the lowest 
      biodegradation rate. This research offers feasible methods for the removal of BPA in 
      river sediment for bioremediation.

AB  - A lignin degradation bacterial consortium named LDC was screened from the sludge of 
      a reeds pond by a restricted subculture. It could break down 60.9% lignin in reeds 
      at 30°C under conditions of static culture within 15 days. In order to analyze the 
      diversity of LDC, plate isolation, 16S rDNA clone library and ARDRA (Amplified 
      Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis) were performed. Six bacterial strains were 
      isolated from LDC and eighteen DNA phylotypes were identified from 230 bacterial 
      analyzed clones. They were classified into Clostridiales(9.1%), Geovibrio thiophilus 
      (5.1%), Desulfomicrobium (10.9%), Pseudomonas sp. (25.2%), Azoarcus sp. (5.1%), 
      Thauera (5.1%), Paenibacillus sp. (5.1%), Cohnella sp. (2.2%), Acinetobacter sp. 
      (3.1%), Microbacterium (7.8%), and uncultured bacterium (21.3%). In addition, 
      physical characteristics of paper hand-sheets between biological pretreatment and 
      chemical pretreatment were compared. The results showed that LDC had the capability 
      of lignin degradation and was efficient for pulping, which would provide a new 
      choice for biopulping.

AB  - A bacterial consortium that degrades cooking oil (CO) has been isolated in 
      wastewater (WW) samples, by enrichment in olive CO. This consortium could degrade 
      90% of CO within 7-9 days (from an initial 1% [w/v]), and it is more active at 
      alkaline conditions. The 16S ribonucleic acid (RNA) gene analysis showed that it 
      contains five bacterium species: Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Sphingobacterium sp., 
      Pseudomonas libanensis, Pseudomonas poae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This consortium 
      can degrade the free fatty acids (FFA): palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and 
      linolenic acids; glycerol, glucose and amylose; and albumin, but could not 
      efficiently degrade carboxymethyl-cellulose. Each strain could also degrade CO and 
      FFAs. The level of bacterial crude-activity of extracellular lipases was found to be 
      between 0.2 and 4U/ml. Using synthetic WW, the consortium could reduce 80% of the 
      chemical oxygen demand [from 10550 ± 2828 mg/l], 80% of nitrogen (from 
      410 ± 78 mgl/l) and 57% of phosphorus (from 93 ± 25 mg/l). Thus, this consortium can 
      be utilized in the removal of CO from WW.

AB  - Low efficiency of dye removal by mixed bacterial communities and high rates of dye 
      decolorization by white-rot fungi suggest a combination of both processes to be an 
      option of treatment of textile wastewaters containing dyes and high concentrations 
      of organics. Bacteria were able to remove mono-azo dye but not other chemically 
      different dyes whereas decolorization rates using Irpex lacteus mostly exceeded 90% 
      within less than one week irrespective of dye structure. Decolorization rates for 
      industrial textile wastewaters containing 2-3 different dyes by fungal trickling 
      filters (FTF) attained 91%, 86%, 35% within 5-12 d. Sequential two-step application 
      of FTF and bacterial reactors resulted in efficient decolorization in 1st step 
      (various single dyes, 94-99% within 5 d; wastewater I, 90% within 7 d) and TOC 
      reduction of 95-97% in the two steps. Large potential of combined use of white-rot 
      fungi and traditional bacterial treatment systems for bioremediation of textile 
      wastewaters was demonstrated.

AB  - Increasing the resistance of plant-fermenting bacteria to lignocellulosic inhibitors

      anaerobe that ferments lignocellulosic biomass. We survey the resistance of this 
      bacterium to a panel of biomass inhibitors and then evolve strains that grow in 
      increasing concentrations of the lignin phenolic, ferulic acid, by automated, 
      long-term growth selection in an anaerobic GM3 automat. Ultimately, strains resist 
      multiple inhibitors and grow robustly at the solubility limit of ferulate while 
      retaining the ability to ferment cellulose. We analyze genome-wide transcription 
      patterns during ferulate stress and genomic variants that arose along the ferulate 
      growth selection, revealing how cells adapt to inhibitors through changes in gene 
      dosage and regulation, membrane fatty acid structure, and the surface layer. 
      Collectively, this study demonstrates an automated framework for in vivo directed 
      evolution of anaerobes and gives insight into the genetic mechanisms by which 
      bacteria survive exposure to chemical inhibitors.IMPORTANCE Fermentation of plant 
      biomass is a key part of carbon cycling in diverse ecosystems. Further, industrial 
      biomass fermentation may provide a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. Plants are 
      primarily composed of lignocellulose, a matrix of polysaccharides and polyphenolic 
      lignin. Thus, when microorganisms degrade lignocellulose to access sugars, they also 
      release phenolic and acidic inhibitors. Here, we study how the plant-fermenting 
      bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans resists plant inhibitors using the lignin 
      phenolic, ferulic acid. We examine how the cell responds to abrupt ferulate stress 
      by measuring changes in gene expression. We evolve increasingly resistant strains by 
      automated, long-term cultivation at progressively higher ferulate concentrations and 
      sequence their genomes to identify mutations associated with acquired ferulate 
      resistance. Our study develops an inhibitor-resistant bacterium that ferments 
      cellulose and provides insights into genomic evolution to resist chemical 
      inhibitors.

AB  - A microbial consortium, designated Con R, was established by successive 
      sub-cultivation which can degrade 83% of filter paper after 15 days of incubation 
      over control. Among the 14 bacterial isolates obtained from Con R, only bacterial 
      isolate (R-28) was capable of degrading filter paper. Based on 16S rRNA gene 
      sequence, R-28 was identified as Pseudoxanthomonas sp R-28. After 5 days of 
      incubation, degradation efficiencies of Pseudoxanthomonas sp R-28 on filter paper 
      and pure cellulosic waste were 96% and 95% respectively as compared to control. 
      Pseudoxanthomonas sp R-28 also degraded 60% of non-pretreated rice straw after 7 
      days as compared to control. The degradation kinetics through a modified logistic 
      model showed high correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.965 and 0.665 for cellulosic 
      and rice straw waste degradation respectively. Micro scale structural analysis 
      showed the development of fissures and gaps over time which further supported the 
      degradation potential of Pseudoxanthomonas sp R-28.

AB  - White-rot fungi are efficient degraders of lignin whose extracellular enzymes have a 
      potential to degrade organopollutants. In natural conditions these fungi enter into 
      interactions with other organisms, which may affect their biodegradation capacity. 
      The aim was to investigate the ability of Pleurotus ostreatus to form stable 
      biofilms and to test the capacity of the fungus to degrade Remazol Brilliant Blue R 
      in mixed cultures with bacteria. Bacterial counts were determined to see the 
      behavior of the bacterium in the mixed culture with the fungus. In axenic 
      conditions, the homogenized fungal mycelium was able to form an active biofilm which 
      quickly degraded the dye. The addition of Pseudomonas fluorescens or Bacillus 
      licheniformis bacteria at 10(6)CFU·mL(-1) did not affect the decolorization rate by 
      7-d-old fungal biofilms where the decolorization rate reached 90%. In contrast, when 
      fragments of the fungal mycelium were used for inoculation to pre-formed biofilm of 
      P. fluorescens, the biofilm was allowed to develop for one week's time, no 
      decolorization of RBBR was observed and low activities of MnP and laccase were 
      detected. The use of agar disks covered with fungal mycelium for the inoculation to 
      pre-formed biofilm of P. fluorescens resulted in a fully developed biofilm that 
      decolorized RBBR with similar efficiency as the pure P. ostreatus. The difference 
      between the agar-disk- and homogenized-mycelium inoculated fungal biofilms was 
      corroborated by the measurement of total fungal biofilm biomass that was 6-fold 
      lower in the latter biofilm. Capability of the fungus to overcome the competition of 
      the bacterial biofilm thus depended on the type of fungal growth centres, where 
      intact hyphae were superior to the fragments of mycelium. A similar effect was not 
      observed with the biofilms of B. licheniformis where the bacterial growth was less 
      massive. The ability of P. ostreatus biofilms to resist massive bacterial stress was 
      demonstrated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identification and characterization of a novel bacterial carbohydrate 
      esterase (PaCes7) with application potential for lignocellulose and pesticide 
      degradation. RESULTS: PaCes7 was identified from the lignocellulolytic bacterium, 
      Pantoea ananatis Sd-1 as a new carbohydrate esterase. Recombinant PaCes7 
      heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli showed a clear preference for esters 
      with short-chain fatty acids and exhibited maximum activity towards α-naphthol 
      acetate at 37 °C and pH 7.5. Purified PaCes7 exhibited its catalytic activity under 
      mesophilic conditions and retained more than 40% activity below 30 °C. It displayed 
      a relatively wide pH stability from pH 6-11. Furthermore, the enzyme was strongly 
      resistant to Mg(2+), Pb(2+), and Co(2+) and activated by K(+) and Ca(2+). Both P. 
      ananatis Sd-1 and PaCes7 could degrade the pesticide carbaryl. Additionally, PaCes7 
      was shown to work in combination with cellulase and/or xylanase in rice straw 
      degradation. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that PaCes7 possesses promising 
      biotechnological potential.

AB  - The pulping byproducts (black liquor) cause serious environmental problem due to its 
      high pollution load. In order to search the degradability of black liquor, the 
      potential bacterial strains Citrobacter freundii (FJ581026) and Citrobacter sp. 
      (FJ581023) were applied in axenic and mixed condition. Results revealed that the 
      mixed bacterial culture are more effective than axenic condition and can reduce 82% 
      COD, 79% AOX, 79% color and 60% lignin after 144 h of incubation period. 
      Additionally, the optimum activity of lignin degrading enzyme was noted at 96 h and 
      characterized as manganese peroxidase (MnP) by SDS–PAGE analysis. Further, the HPLC 
      analysis of control and bacterial degraded sample has shown the reduction as well as 
      shifting of peaks compared to control indicating the degradation as well as 
      transformation of compounds of black liquor. The comparative GC-MS analysis of 
      control and degraded black liquor revealed that along with lignin fragment some 
      chlorophenolic compounds 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol and 
      pentachlorophenol were detected in black liquor degraded by axenic culture whereas 
      these chlorophenolic compounds were completely absent in black liquor degraded by 
      mixed bacterial culture. These chlorophenol inhibit the oxidative degradation which 
      seems a major reason behind the low degradability of axenic degradation compared to 
      mixed culture. The innovation of this aerobic treatment of alkaline black liquor 
      opens additional possibilities for the better treatment of black liquor along with 
      its metabolic product.

AB  - The effects of cabbage waste (CW) addition on methane production in cow dung and 
      corn straw co-fermentation systems were investigated. Four experimental groups, each 
      containing 55 g of substrate, were set up as follows: 100% cow dung (C); 36% cabbage 
      and 64% cow dung (CC); 36% straw and 64% cow dung (SC); and 18% cabbage, 18% straw, 
      and 64% cow dung (CSC). After seven days of fermentation, the maximum methane yield 
      was 134 mL in the CSC group, which was 2.81-fold, 1.78-fold, and 1340-fold higher 
      than that obtained in the CC, SC, and C groups, respectively. CW treatment of the 
      CSC group enhanced cellulase activity and enriched culturable cellulose-degrading 
      bacterial strains. Miseq sequencing data revealed that the predominant phylum in the 
      CSC group was Bacteroidetes, which contains most of the cellulose-degrading 
      bacteria. Our results suggested that CW treatment elevated cellulose degradation and 
      promoted methane production.

AB  - Composting is a promising method for the management of agricultural wastes. However, 
      results for wheat straw composts with different carbon-to-nitrogen ratios revealed 
      that wheat straw was only partly degraded after composting for 25days, with 
      hemicellulose and cellulose content decreasing by 14% and 33%, respectively. No 
      significant changes in community structure were found after composting according to 
      454-pyrosequencing. Bacterial communities were represented by Proteobacteria and 
      Bacteroidetes throughout the composting process, including relatively high 
      abundances of pathogenic microbes such as Pseudomonas and Flexibacter, suggesting 
      that innocent treatment of the composts had not been achieved. Besides, the 
      significant lignocellulose degrader Thermomyces was not the exclusively dominant 
      fungus with relative abundance only accounting for 19% of fungal communities. These 
      results indicated that comparing with maize straw, wheat straw was an inefficient 
      substrate for rapid natural lignocellulose-based composting, which might be due to 
      the recalcitrance of wheat straw.

TI  - Use of cellulolytic marine bacteria for enzymatic pretreatment in microalgal biogas 
      production.
PG  - 4199-206
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00827-14 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we designed and evaluated a microalgal pretreatment method using 
      cellulolytic bacteria that naturally degrades microalgae in their native habitat. 
      Bacterial strains were isolated from each of two mollusk species in a medium 
      containing 1% carboxymethyl cellulose agar. We selected nine bacterial strains that 
      had endoglucanase activity: five strains from Mytilus chilensis, a Chilean mussel, 
      and four strains from Mesodesma donacium, a clam found in the Southern Pacific. 
      These strains were identified phylogenetically as belonging to the genera Aeromonas, 
      Pseudomonas, Chryseobacterium, and Raoultella. The cellulase-producing capacities of 
      these strains were characterized, and the degradation of cell walls in Botryococcus 
      braunii and Nannochloropsis gaditana was tested with "whole-cell" cellulolytic 
      experiments. Aeromonas bivalvium MA2, Raoultella ornithinolytica MA5, and Aeromonas 
      salmonicida MC25 degraded B. braunii, and R. ornithinolytica MC3 and MA5 degraded N. 
      gaditana. In addition, N. gaditana was pretreated with R. ornithinolytica strains 
      MC3 and MA5 and was then subjected to an anaerobic digestion process, which 
      increased the yield of methane by 140.32% and 158.68%, respectively, over that from 
      nonpretreated microalgae. Therefore, a "whole-cell" cellulolytic pretreatment can 
      increase the performance and efficiency of biogas production.

AB  - Pseudomonas putida is one of 13 major groups of Pseudomonas spp. and contains 
      numerous species occupying diverse niches and performing many functions such as 
      plant growth promotion and bioremediation. Here we compared a set of 19 P. putida 
      isolates obtained from sugarcane rhizosphere or bulk soil using a population 
      genomics approach aiming to assess genomic and metabolic differences between 
      populations from these habitats. Phylogenomics placed rhizosphere versus bulk soil 
      strains in separate clades clustering with different type strains of the P. putida 
      group. Multivariate analyses indicated that the rhizosphere and bulk soil isolates 
      form distinct populations. Comparative genomics identified several genetic functions 
      (GO-terms) significantly different between populations, including some exclusively 
      present in the rhizosphere or bulk soil strains, such as D-galactonic acid 
      catabolism and cellulose biosynthesis, respectively. The metabolic profiles of 
      rhizosphere and bulk soil populations analyzed by Biolog Ecoplates also differ 
      significantly, most notably by the higher oxidation of D-galactonic/D-galacturonic 
      acid by the rhizosphere population. Accordingly, D-galactonate catabolism operon 
      (dgo) was present in all rhizosphere isolates and absent in the bulk soil 
      population. This study showed that sugarcane rhizosphere and bulk soil harbor 
      different populations of P. putida and identified genes and functions potentially 
      associated with their soil niches.

LID - 10.1007/s11274-018-2414-y [doi]
AB  - A gram positive, rod shaped, bacterium was isolated from pulp and paper mill sludge 
      and characterized as Brevibacillus parabrevis (MTCC 12105) by biochemical tests and 
      16S rRNA gene sequencing. C(D) and E(OP) stage wastewater, collected from a leading 
      pulp and paper mill situated in North India, was used for degradation study. 
      Wastewater degradation efficiency of the bacterial isolate was evaluated by Flask 
      study in batch mode and Reactor study in semi continuous mode. The isolated 
      bacterium showed a considerable reduction of the colour (59%), chemical oxygen 
      demand (62%) and lignin (53.8%) content of Kraft paper mill effluent at 37 °C after 
      5 days. During reactor study it reduced 42.6% Lignin, 51.6% Colour and 60.3% COD 
      (chemical oxygen demand) of the wastewater at 48 h RT (retention time). The isolate 
      was deposited at MTCC Chandigarh, India with an accession no. MTCC 12105.

TI  - Evaluating bacterial community structures in oil collected from the sea surface and 
      sediment in the northern Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

AB  - Bacterial community structures were evaluated in oil samples using 
      culture-independent pyrosequencing, including oil mousses collected on sea surface 
      and salt marshes during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and oil deposited in 
      sediments adjacent to the wellhead 1 year after the spill. Phylogenetic analysis 
      suggested that Erythrobacter, Rhodovulum, Stappia, and Thalassospira of 
      Alphaproteobacteria were the prevailing groups in the oil mousses, which may relate 
      to high temperatures and strong irradiance in surface Gulf waters. In the mousse 
      collected from the leaves of Spartina alterniflora, Vibrio of Gammaproteobacteria 
      represented 57% of the total operational taxonomic units, suggesting that this 
      indigenous genus is particularly responsive to the oil contamination in salt 
      marshes. The bacterial communities in oil-contaminated sediments were highly 
      diversified. The relatively high abundance of the Methylococcus, Methylobacter, 
      Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chlorofexi bacteria resembles those found in certain 
      cold-seep sediments with gas hydrates. Bacterial communities in the overlying water 
      of the oil-contaminated sediment were dominated by Ralstonia of Betaproteobacteria, 
      which can degrade small aromatics, and Saccharophagus degradans of 
      Gammaproteobacteria, a cellulose degrader, suggesting that overlying water was 
      affected by the oil-contaminated sediments, possibly due to the dissolution of small 
      aromatics and biosurfactants produced during biodegradation. Overall, these results 
      provided key information needed to evaluate oil degradation in the region and 
      develop future bioremediation strategies.

TI  - Expression and secretion of a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase by a fast-growing 
      cyanobacterium.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyanobacteria have the potential to become next-generation cell 
      factories due to their ability to use CO(2), light and inorganic nutrients to 
      produce a range of biomolecules of commercial interest. Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 
      2973, in particular, is a fast-growing, genetically tractable, cyanobacterium that 
      has garnered attention as a potential biotechnological chassis. To establish this 
      unique strain as a host for heterologous protein production, we aimed to demonstrate 
      expression and secretion of the industrially relevant TfAA10A, a lytic 
      polysaccharide monooxygenase from the Gram-positive bacterium Thermobifida fusca. 
      RESULTS: Two variations of TfAA10A were successfully expressed in S. elongatus UTEX 
      2973: One containing the native N-terminal, Sec-targeted, signal peptide and a 
      second with a Tat-targeted signal peptide from the Escherichia coli 
      trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (TorA). Although the TorA signal peptide correctly 
      targeted the protein to the plasma membrane, the majority of the TorA-TfAA10A was 
      found unprocessed in the plasma membrane with a small fraction of the mature protein 
      ultimately translocated to the periplasm. The native Sec signal peptide allowed for 
      efficient secretion of TfAA10A into the medium with virtually no protein being found 
      in the cytosol, plasma membrane or periplasm. TfAA10A was demonstrated to be 
      correctly cleaved and active on the model substrate phosphoric acid swollen 
      cellulose. Additionally, expression and secretion only had a minor impact on cell 
      growth. The secretion yield was estimated at 779 ± 40 µg L(-1) based on 
      densitometric analysis. To our knowledge, this is the highest secretion yield ever 
      registered in cyanobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown for the first time 
      high-titer expression and secretion of an industrially relevant and catalytically 
      active enzyme in S. elongatus UTEX 2973. This proof-of-concept study will be 
      valuable for the development of novel and sustainable applications in the fields of 
      bioremediation and biocatalysis.

AB  - This study aimed to develop an ectopic fermentation system (EFS) to reduce the 
      pollution of cow wastewater and to provide a basis for the production of 
      biofertilizer with fermentation residues. Six thermophilic strains, three of which 
      have efficient cellulose-degrading abilities and the other have good ammonia-N 
      utilizing abilities, were chosen as the microbial inocula. The results showed that 
      EFS inoculated with microbial consortium brought higher temperature and more 
      wastewater was needed to ensure continuous fermentation. The pH values decreased in 
      the early stage of fermentation, and then increased during the process. It caused 
      increases in total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorous, and total potassium 
      content. Decreases in organic matter content and C/N ratio were also observed. The 
      high level of nutrients indicated the suitability of the paddings after fermentation 
      for agronomic uses. It firstly attempted to combine cow wastewater treatment and 
      bio-organic fertilizer production by EFS with mixed microbial culture.

AB  - Six different environmental samples were applied to enrich microbial consortia for 
      efficient degradation of corn stalk, under the thermophilic and mesophilic 
      conditions. The consortium obtained from anaerobic digested sludge under 
      thermophilic condition (TC-Y) had the highest lignocellulose-degrading activity. The 
      CO(2) yield was 246.73 mL/g VS in 23 days, meanwhile, the maximum CO(2) production 
      rate was 15.48 mL/(CO(2)·d), which was 28.75% and 52.27% higher than that under 
      mesophilic condition, respectively. The peak value of cellulase activity reached 
      0.105 U/mL, which was at least 34.61% higher than the other groups. In addition, 
      49.5% of corn stalk was degraded in 20 days, moreover, the degradation ratio of 
      cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin can reach 52.76%, 62.45% and 42.23%, 
      respectively. Microbial consortium structure analysis indicated that the TC-Y 
      contained the phylum of Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, 
      Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the Pseudoxanthomonas 
      belonging to GammaProteobacteria might be the key bacterial group for the 
      lignocellulose degradation. These results indicated the capability of degrading 
      un-pretreated corn stalk and the potential for further investigation and application 
      of TC-Y.

AB  - The prospection of new degrading enzymes of the plant cell wall has been the subject 
      of many studies and is fundamental for industries, due to the great biotechnological 
      importance of achieving a more efficient depolymerization conversion from plant 
      polysaccharides to fermentable sugars, which are useful not only for biofuel 
      production but also for various bioproducts. Thus, we explored the shotgun 
      metagenome data of a bacterial community (CB10) isolated from sugarcane bagasse and 
      recovered three metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). The genomic distance analyses, 
      along with phylogenetic analysis, revealed the presence of a putative novel 
      Chitinophaga species, a Pandoraea nosoerga, and Labrys sp. isolate. The isolation 
      process for each one of these bacterial lineages from the community was carried out 
      in order to relate them with the MAGs. The recovered draft genomes have reasonable 
      completeness (72.67-100%) and contamination (0.26-2.66%) considering the respective 
      marker lineage for Chitinophaga (Bacteroidetes), Pandoraea (Burkholderiales), and 
      Labrys (Rhizobiales). The in-vitro assay detected cellulolytic activity 
      (endoglucanases) only for the isolate Chitinophaga, and its genome analysis revealed 
      319 CAZymes, of which 115 are classified as plant cell wall degrading enzymes, which 
      can act in fractions of hemicellulose and pectin. Our study highlights the potential 
      of this Chitinophaga isolate provides several plant-polysaccharide-degrading 
      enzymes.

TI  - Wood decomposition in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the tropics: contrasting 
      biotic and abiotic processes.
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiy223 [doi]
AB  - Wood decomposition, a critical process in carbon and nutrient cycles, is influenced 
      by environmental conditions, decomposer communities and substrate composition. While 
      these factors differ between land and stream habitats, across-habitat comparisons of 
      wood decay processes are rare, limiting our ability to evaluate the context- 
      dependency of the drivers of decay. Here we tracked wood decomposition of three tree 
      species placed in stream and terrestrial habitats in a lowland tropical forest in 
      Panama. At 3 and 11 months we measured mass loss, wood nitrogen and wood polymer 
      concentrations, and sampled wood-associated fungal and bacterial communities. After 
      11 months of decay we found that mass loss occurred 9% faster in streams than on 
      land, but loss of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin did not differ between 
      habitats. We also observed large differences in microbial decomposer communities 
      between habitats. Overall, we found faster mass loss of wood in water, but no 
      differences in biotic decay processes between habitats despite distinct microbial 
      communities in streams and on land. Our research challenges the assumption that wood 
      decays relatively slowly in water reflecting unfavorable environmental conditions 
      and a limited capacity of aquatic microbial communities to effectively degrade wood 
      polymers.

AB  - This study deals with the decolorization of black liquor (BL) by isolated potential 
      bacterial consortium comprising Serratia marcescens (GU193982), Citrobacter sp. 
      (HQ873619) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (GU193983). The decolorization of BL was 
      studied by using the different nutritional as well as environmental parameters. In 
      this study, result revealed that the ligninolytic activities were found to be growth 
      associated and the developed bacterial consortium was efficient for the reduction of 
      COD, BOD and color up to 83%, 74% and 85%, respectively. The HPLC analysis of 
      degraded samples of BL has shown the reduction in peak area compared to control. 
      Further, the GC-MS analysis showed that, most of the compounds detected in control 
      were diminished after bacterial treatment while, formic acid hydrazide, 
      4-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, carbamic acid, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid and 
      erythropentanoic acid were found as new metabolites. Further, the seed germination 
      test using Phaseolus aureus has supported the detoxification of bacterial 
      decolorized BL.

AB  - To enhance the degradation of wheat straw (WS) and corn straw (CS) in rumen 
      fermentation, characterization of degradation and ruminal microorganisms of 
      monosubstrate (WS/CS) groups and a cosubstrate strategy with food waste (FW) group 
      was performed. The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin degradation efficiency of WS 
      and CS; soluble chemical oxygen demand; volatile fatty acid yields; and activity of 
      ligninolytic, cellulolytic, and hemicellulolytic enzymes for the cosubstrate group 
      were improved compared with those for the corresponding monosubstrate groups. An 
      accurate and a good of fit of the Weibull kinetic model, decreased crystallinity 
      index values, and characteristic absorbance bands in the Fourier transform-infrared 
      spectra further confirmed that cosubstrate addition with FW decreased the resistance 
      of cellulose and hemicellulose to biodegradation. High-throughput sequencing results 
      suggested that the bacterial diversity in CS rumen fermentation and fungal diversity 
      and richness in WS rumen fermentation were promoted with FW as a cosubstrate. The 
      cosubstrate addition with FW significantly affected the composition of the ruminal 
      bacteria and fungi in rumen fermentation. The relative abundances (RAs) of rumen 
      bacteria were increased in the cosubstrate CS/WS and FW fermentation conditions, and 
      the enhancement of CS degradation with FW supplementation was stronger than that of 
      WS rumen fermentation with FW supplementation. The RAs of the ruminal fungal genera 
      Ustilago and Fusarium were promoted in CS and WS fermentation with FW, respectively. 
      Moreover, the fermentation properties and rumen flora in the FW rumen fermentation 
      also provided some evidence to suggest an enhancement of the cosubstrate strategy 
      compared with the monosubstrate strategy.

AB  - Nine aerobic cellulolytic bacterial cultures were obtained from the Leibniz 
      Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Culture (DSMZ) and the 
      American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The objectives of this study were to 
      characterize the cellulolytic bacteria and to determine the optimum moisture ratio 
      required for solid state fermentation (SSF) of palm kernel cake (PKC). The bacteria 
      cultures were grown on reconstituted nutrient broth, incubated at 30°C and agitated 
      at 200 rpm. Carboxymethyl cellulase, xylanase, and mannanase activities were 
      determined using different substrates and after SSF of PKC. The SSF was conducted 
      for 4 and 7 days with inoculum size of 10% (v/w) on different PKC 
      concentration-to-moisture ratios: 1 : 0.2, 1 : 0.3, 1 : 0.4, and 1 : 0.5. Results 
      showed that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 1067 DSMZ, Bacillus megaterium 9885 ATCC, 
      Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus 10248 DSMZ, and Paenibacillus polymyxa 842 ATCC 
      produced higher enzyme activities as compared to other bacterial cultures grown on 
      different substrates. The cultures mentioned above also produced higher enzyme 
      activities when they were incubated under SSF using PKC as a substrate in different 
      PKC-to-moisture ratios after 4 days of incubation, indicating that these 
      cellulolytic bacteria can be used to degrade and improve the nutrient quality of 
      PKC.

AB  - The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into bioethanol or biochemical products 
      requires a crucial pretreatment process to breakdown the recalcitrant lignin 
      structure. This research focuses on the isolation and characterization of a 
      lignin-degrading bacterial strain from a decaying oil palm empty fruit bunch 
      (OPEFB). The isolated strain, identified as Streptomyces sp. S6, grew in a minimal 
      medium with Kraft lignin (KL) as the sole carbon source. Several known ligninolytic 
      enzyme assays were performed, and lignin peroxidase (LiP), laccase (Lac), 
      dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) and aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO) activities were 
      detected. A 55.3% reduction in the molecular weight (Mw) of KL was observed after 7 
      days of incubation with Streptomyces sp. S6 based on gel-permeation chromatography 
      (GPC). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) also successfully highlighted 
      the production of lignin-derived aromatic compounds, such as 3-methyl-butanoic acid, 
      guaiacol derivatives, and 4,6-dimethyl-dodecane, after treatment of KL with 
      strain S6. Finally, draft genome analysis of Streptomyces sp. S6 also revealed the 
      presence of strong lignin degradation machinery and identified various candidate 
      genes responsible for lignin depolymerization, as well as for the mineralization of 
      the lower molecular weight compounds, confirming the lignin degradation capability 
      of the bacterial strain.

AB  - Due to high pollution load and colour contributing substances, pulp and paper mill 
      effluents cause serious aquatic and soil pollution. A lignin-degrading bacterial 
      strain capable of decolourising Azure-B dye was identified as lignin peroxidase 
      (LiP) producing strain LD-5. The strain was isolated from pulp and paper mill 
      effluent contaminated site. Biochemical and 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis 
      suggested that strain LD-5 belonged to the Serratia liquefaciens. The strain LD-5 
      effectively reduced pollution parameters (colour 72%, lignin 58%, COD 85% and phenol 
      95%) of real effluent after 144h of treatment at 30°C, pH 7.6 and 120rpm. 
      Extracellular LiP produced by S. liquefaciens during effluent decolourisation was 
      purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate (AMS) precipitation and DEAE 
      cellulose column chromatography. The molecular weight of the purified lignin 
      peroxidase was estimated to be ∼28kDa. Optimum pH and temperature for purified 
      lignin peroxidase activity were determined as pH 6.0 and 40°C, respectively. 
      Detoxified effluent was evaluated for residual toxicity by alkaline single cell 
      (comet) gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay using Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC 36 as 
      model organism. The toxicity reduction to treated effluent was 49.4%. These findings 
      suggest significant potential of S. liquefaciens for bioremediation of pulp and 
      paper mill effluent.

AB  - Epigeic earthworms can significantly hasten the decomposition of organic matter, 
      which is known to be mediated by gut associated microflora. However, there is scanty 
      information on the abundance and diversity of the gut bacterial flora in different 
      earthworm genera fed with a similar diet, particularly Eisenia foetida and Perionyx 
      excavatus. In this context, 16S rDNA based clonal survey of gut metagenomic DNA was 
      assessed after growth of these two earthworms on lignocellulosic biomass. A set of 
      67 clonal sequences belonging to E. foetida and 75 to P. excavatus were 
      taxonomically annotated using MG-RAST and RDP pipeline servers. Highest number of 
      sequences were annotated to Proteobacteria (38-44%), followed by unclassified 
      bacteria (14-18%) and Firmicutes (9.3-11%). Comparative analyses revealed 
      significantly higher abundance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes in the gut of P. 
      excavatus. The functional annotation for the 16S rDNA clonal libraries of both the 
      metagenomes revealed a high abundance of xylan degraders (12.1-24.1%). However, 
      chitin degraders (16.7%), ammonia oxidizers (24.1%) and nitrogen fixers (7.4%) were 
      relatively higher in E. foetida, while in P. excavatus; sulphate reducers and 
      sulphate oxidizers (12.1-29.6%) were more abundant. Lignin degradation was detected 
      in 3.7% clones of E. foetida, while cellulose degraders represented 1.7%. The gut 
      microbiomes showed relative abundance of dehalogenators (17.2-22.2%) and aromatic 
      hydrocarbon degraders (1.7-5.6%), illustrating their role in bioremediation. This 
      study highlights the significance of differences in the inherent microbiome of these 
      two earthworms in shaping the metagenome for effective degradation of different 
      types of biomass under tropical conditions.

AB  - A bio-catalyzed process has been developed for treating jute fibers to enhance their 
      tensile strength and resistance against biodegradation. Lipolytic bacteria were used 
      in the process to transesterify jute fibers by replacing hydrophilic hydroxyl groups 
      within cellulose chains with hydrophobic fatty acyl chains. Transesterification of 
      some of the hydroxyl groups within the fiber was confirmed with FTIR, UV-vis 
      spectroscopy, (13)C solid state NMR, gas chromatography and analytical determination 
      of ester content. Biomodified fibers exhibited remarkably smaller affinity to water 
      and moisture and retained 62% of their initial tensile strengths after being exposed 
      to a composting environment over 21 days. The corresponding figure for untreated 
      fibers was only 30%. Efficacy of the process reported herein in terms of tensile 
      strength and biodegradation resistance enhancement of fibers achieved after 
      treatment appears to be comparable with similar chemical processes and better than 
      the enzyme-catalyzed alternatives.

TI  - Construction of Effective Minimal Active Microbial Consortia for Lignocellulose 
      Degradation.
PG  - 419-429
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1141-5 [doi]
AB  - Enriched microbial communities, obtained from environmental samples through 
      selective processes, can effectively contribute to lignocellulose degradation. 
      Unfortunately, fully controlled industrial degradation processes are difficult to 
      reach given the intrinsically dynamic nature and complexity of the microbial 
      communities, composed of a large number of culturable and unculturable species. The 
      use of less complex but equally effective microbial consortia could improve their 
      applications by allowing for more controlled industrial processes. Here, we combined 
      ecological theory and enrichment principles to develop an effective 
      lignocellulose-degrading minimal active microbial Consortia (MAMC). Following an 
      enrichment of soil bacteria capable of degrading lignocellulose material from 
      sugarcane origin, we applied a reductive-screening approach based on molecular 
      phenotyping, identification, and metabolic characterization to obtain a selection of 
      18 lignocellulose-degrading strains representing four metabolic functional groups. 
      We then generated 65 compositional replicates of MAMC containing five species each, 
      which vary in the number of functional groups, metabolic potential, and degradation 
      capacity. The characterization of the MAMC according to their degradation capacities 
      and functional diversity measurements revealed that functional diversity positively 
      correlated with the degradation of the most complex lignocellulosic fraction 
      (lignin), indicating the importance of metabolic complementarity, whereas cellulose 
      and hemicellulose degradation were either negatively or not affected by functional 
      diversity. The screening method described here successfully led to the selection of 
      effective MAMC, whose degradation potential reached up 96.5% of the degradation 
      rates when all 18 species were present. A total of seven assembled synthetic 
      communities were identified as the most effective MAMC. A consortium containing 
      Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Paenibacillus sp., Microbacterium sp., 
      Chryseobacterium taiwanense, and Brevundimonas sp. was found to be the most 
      effective degrading synthetic community.

AB  - A lignin peroxidases-producing Serratia liquefaciens was used for bioremediation of 
      pulp and paper (P&P) mill effluent. The treatment led to reduction of chemical 
      oxygen demand (COD), colour, lignin and phenolic content by 84%, 72%, 61% and 95%, 
      respectively. The effluent detoxification was studied by genotoxicity assays using 
      Allium cepa L. (onion) root tip cells. Genotoxicity studies included measuring 
      mitotic index (MI), chromosomal aberrations (CA) and nuclear abnormalities (NA) in 
      root tip cells following treatment with 25, 50, 75 and 100% (v/v) of effluent. The 
      root tip cells grown in untreated effluent showed a significant decrease in MI from 
      69% (control) to 32%, 27%, 22% and 11% at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% effluent 
      concentration, respectively. This indicated that the untreated effluent was highly 
      cytotoxic in nature. Further, root tip cells, when treated with different 
      concentrations of effluent showed various CA and NA including c-mitosis, stickiness, 
      chromosome loss, chromosome break, anaphase bridge, multipolar anaphase, vagrant 
      chromosomes, micronucleated and binucleated cells. The MI observed in root tip cells 
      grown in bacterial treated effluents at similar concentrations (25, 50, 75 and 100% 
      v/v) showed an increase of 33%, 36%, 42% and 66%. CA showed a substantial decrease 
      and in some instances, complete absence of CA was also observed. The findings 
      suggest that S. liquefaciens culture could be a potential bacterial culture for 
      bioremediation of P&P mill effluent, as it is effective in substantial lowering of 
      pollutants load as well as reduces the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of effluent.

TI  - A tailored permeable reactive bio-barrier for in situ groundwater remediation: 
      removal of 3-chlorophenol as a case study.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/09593330.2020.1822922 [doi]
AB  - The present study explored bacterial aerobic biodegradation of reduced 
      carbon-contaminants (RCC) in a pilot system mimicking remediation of a saturated 
      aquifer in a permeable reactive biobarrier (PRBB). Bioaugmentation was performed 
      with a pure culture of Pseudomonas putida macro-encapsulated in a cellulose-acetate 
      porous envelope and integrated transversely to the flow trajectory of the fluid in 
      the biobarrier and compared with controls without capsules. The macro-encapsulation 
      technique applied allowed the incorporation of a built-in nutrient core for the slow 
      release of macronutrients, i.e. N, P, instead of exogenous nutrients supply. 
      3-Chlorophenol (3CP) at a concentration range of 350-500 mg/L was chosen as an RCC 
      model compound. The findings indicate efficient 3CP biodegradation during the PRBB 
      operation with a similar degree of transformation (76 ± 2% and 72 ± 2%) and 
      mineralization (55 ± 4% vs. 49 ± 3%) for exogenous and built-in nutrients supply, 
      respectively. The extent of dechlorination in both cases (54 ± 10% vs. 40 ± 2%, 
      respectively) followed mineralization rather than transformation, suggesting that 
      Cl(-) release took place in late transformation stages. Negligible decontamination 
      was observed in the control system without bioaugmentation. Concluding, tailored 
      PRBB with macro-capsules incorporating a built-in nutrient core to support bacterial 
      growth presents a significant environmental advantage controlling excess nutrients 
      release required in bioremediation of oligotrophic systems.

PG  - 257-61
LID - 10.1002/biot.201100503 [doi]
AB  - Immobilization of enzymes onto nanoparticles for enhanced biocatalytic activity via 
      enzyme clustering is a growing field. In this paper, the effect of nanoparticle size 
      on the hydrolytic activity of artificial cellulosomes was investigated. A simple 
      method based on metal affinity coordination was employed to directly conjugate two 
      enzymes, an endoglucanase CelA and an exoglucanase CelE, onto CdSe-ZnS core-shell 
      quantum dots (QDs) without the use of any chemical modification or linker molecules 
      such as streptavidin. Artificial cellulosomes were created by clustering the enzymes 
      onto two different QDs (5 and 10 nm) to systematically study the influence of 
      particle size and QD to enzyme ratio on the enhancement in cellulose hydrolysis. Our 
      results indicate that enzyme proximity is the most important factor for activity 
      enhancement while the influence of particle size is relatively modest. This detailed 
      understanding will provide insights for the design of other artificial cellulosomes 
      based on nanoclustering of multiple catalytic domains with significantly enhanced 
      activities, and may be applicable for designing improved nanobiocatalysts for 
      biofuel production, bioremediation, and drug design.

TI  - Biodegradation of lignin by Pseudomonas sp. Q18 and the characterization of a novel 
      bacterial DyP-type peroxidase.
PG  - 913-927
LID - 10.1007/s10295-018-2064-y [doi]
AB  - Lignin valorization can be obtained through cleavage of selected bonds by microbial 
      enzymes, in which lignin is segregated from cellulose and hemicellulose and abundant 
      phenolic compounds can be provided. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. Q18, previously 
      isolated from rotten wood in China, was used to degrade alkali lignin and raw 
      lignocellulosic material. Gel-permeation chromatography, field-emission scanning 
      electron microscope, and GC-MS were combined to investigate the degradation process. 
      The GC-MS results revealed that the quantities of aromatic compounds with phenol 
      ring from lignin increased significantly after incubation with Pseudomonas sp. Q18, 
      which indicated the degradation of lignin. According to the lignin-derived 
      metabolite analysis, it was proposed that a DyP-type peroxidase (PmDyP) might exist 
      in strain Q18. Thereafter, the gene of PmDyP was cloned and expressed, after which 
      the recombinant PmDyP was purified and the enzymatic kinetics of PmDyP were assayed. 
      According to results, PmDyP showed promising characteristics for lignocellulosic 
      biodegradation in biorefinery.

AB  - Bacterial systems have drawn an increasing amount of attention on lignin 
      valorization due to their rapid growth and powerful environmental adaptability. In 
      this study, Klebsiella pneumoniae NX-1, Pseudomonas putida NX-1, and Ochrobactrum 
      tritici NX-1 with ligninolytic potential were isolated from leaf mold samples. Their 
      ligninolytic capabilities were determined by measuring (1) the cell growth on kraft 
      lignin as the sole carbon source, (2) the decolorization of kraft lignin and 
      lignin-mimicking dyes, (3) the micro-morphology changes and transformations of 
      chemical groups in kraft lignin, and (4) the ligninolytic enzyme activities of these 
      three isolates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that 
      Ochrobactrum tritici species can depolymerize and metabolize lignin. Moreover, 
      laccase, lignin peroxidase, and Mn-peroxidase showed high activities in P. putida 
      NX-1. Due to their excellent ligninolytic capabilities, these three bacteria are 
      important supplements to ligninolytic bacteria library and could be valuable in 
      lignin valorization.

TI  - In Vitro Enzymatic Depolymerization of Lignin with Release of Syringyl, Guaiacyl, 
      and Tricin Units.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02076-17 [doi]
LID - e02076-17
AB  - New environmentally sound technologies are needed to derive valuable compounds from 
      renewable resources. Lignin, an abundant polymer in terrestrial plants comprised 
      predominantly of guaiacyl and syringyl monoaromatic phenylpropanoid units, is a 
      potential natural source of aromatic compounds. In addition, the plant secondary 
      metabolite tricin is a recently discovered and moderately abundant flavonoid in 
      grasses. The most prevalent interunit linkage between guaiacyl, syringyl, and tricin 
      units is the β-ether linkage. Previous studies have shown that bacterial β-etherase 
      pathway enzymes catalyze glutathione-dependent cleavage of β-ether bonds in dimeric 
      β-ether lignin model compounds. To date, however, it remains unclear whether the 
      known β-etherase enzymes are active on lignin polymers. Here we report on enzymes 
      that catalyze β-ether cleavage from bona fide lignin, under conditions that recycle 
      the cosubstrates NAD(+) and glutathione. Guaiacyl, syringyl, and tricin derivatives 
      were identified as reaction products when different model compounds or lignin 
      fractions were used as substrates. These results demonstrate an in vitro enzymatic 
      system that can recycle cosubstrates while releasing aromatic monomers from model 
      compounds as well as natural and engineered lignin oligomers. These findings can 
      improve the ability to produce valuable aromatic compounds from a renewable resource 
      like lignin.IMPORTANCE Many bacteria are predicted to contain enzymes that could 
      convert renewable carbon sources into substitutes for compounds that are derived 
      from petroleum. The β-etherase pathway present in sphingomonad bacteria could cleave 
      the abundant β-O-4-aryl ether bonds in plant lignin, releasing a biobased source of 
      aromatic compounds for the chemical industry. However, the activity of these enzymes 
      on the complex aromatic oligomers found in plant lignin is unknown. Here we 
      demonstrate biodegradation of lignin polymers using a minimal set of β-etherase 
      pathway enzymes, the ability to recycle needed cofactors (glutathione and NAD(+)) in 
      vitro, and the release of guaiacyl, syringyl, and tricin as depolymerized products 
      from lignin. These observations provide critical evidence for the use and future 
      optimization of these bacterial β-etherase pathway enzymes for industrial-level 
      biotechnological applications designed to derive high-value monomeric aromatic 
      compounds from lignin.

TI  - Diffusion characteristics and controlled release of bacterial fertilizers from 
      modified calcium alginate capsules.
PG  - 1904-10
AB  - An indigenous Cellulosimicrobium cellulans GS6 isolate able to solubilize insoluble 
      phosphate complexes in soil is a potential bacterial fertilizer. Enclosure of the 
      phosphate-solubilizing bacterium (PSB) in biodegradable capsules may protect the PSB 
      cells inoculated into soil and, in the meantime, enable the control of cell release 
      that confers long-term fertilizing effects. In this study, calcium alginate (CA) was 
      used as the core matrix to encapsulate cells of C. cellulans GS6. The 
      cell-liberating properties of the CA-based capsules were modified by blending with a 
      variety of supplemental materials (SM), including chitin, cellulose, olive oil, and 
      gelatin. The experimental results showed that the maximum cell-release percentage 
      (MCR%) of the capsules decreased in the order of CA-cellulose>CA-olive 
      oil>CA-chitin>CA-gelatin>CA. Furthermore, a mass transport model was developed to 
      accurately describe the kinetics of cell release results for each capsule. The 
      diffusion coefficient (D(e)) of each capsule was also determined from the model 
      simulation. We found that the estimated D(e) values are positively correlated to the 
      release rate with rare exceptions. Lastly, as our results underscored the crucial 
      roles that the type of capsules plays in the rate and amount of cell release, 
      controlled release of the bacterial fertilizer (C. cellulans GS6 cells) may be 
      achieved via the design of capsule materials.

TI  - Stable-Isotope Probing Identifies Uncultured Planctomycetes as Primary Degraders of 
      a Complex Heteropolysaccharide in Soil.
PG  - 4607-15
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00055-15 [doi]
AB  - The exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by some bacteria are potential growth 
      substrates for other bacteria in soil. We used stable-isotope probing (SIP) to 
      identify aerobic soil bacteria that assimilated the cellulose produced by 
      Gluconacetobacter xylinus or the EPS produced by Beijerinckia indica. The latter is 
      a heteropolysaccharide comprised primarily of l-guluronic acid, d-glucose, and 
      d-glycero-d-mannoheptose. (13)C-labeled EPS and (13)C-labeled cellulose were 
      purified from bacterial cultures grown on [(13)C]glucose. Two soils were incubated 
      with these substrates, and bacteria actively assimilating them were identified via 
      pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes recovered from (13)C-labeled DNA. Cellulose C was 
      assimilated primarily by soil bacteria closely related (93 to 100% 16S rRNA gene 
      sequence identities) to known cellulose-degrading bacteria. However, B. indica EPS 
      was assimilated primarily by bacteria with low identities (80 to 95%) to known 
      species, particularly by different members of the phylum Planctomycetes. In one 
      incubation, members of the Planctomycetes made up >60% of all reads in the labeled 
      DNA and were only distantly related (<85% identity) to any described species. 
      Although it is impossible with SIP to completely distinguish primary polysaccharide 
      hydrolyzers from bacteria growing on produced oligo- or monosaccharides, the 
      predominance of Planctomycetes suggested that they were primary degraders of EPS. 
      Other bacteria assimilating B. indica EPS included members of the Verrucomicrobia, 
      candidate division OD1, and the Armatimonadetes. The results indicate that some 
      uncultured bacteria in soils may be adapted to using complex heteropolysaccharides 
      for growth and suggest that the use of these substrates may provide a means for 
      culturing new species.

AB  - Plastics are uniquely flexible materials that offer considerable benefits as a 
      simple packing to complex engineering material. Traditional synthetic polymers 
      (often called plastics), such as polypropylene and polyethylene have been derived 
      from non-renewable petrochemicals and known to cause environmental concerns due to 
      their non-biodegradable nature. The enormous use of petroleum-based plastic 
      compounds emphasized a need for sustainable alternatives derived from renewable 
      resources. Bioplastics have attracted widespread attention, as eco-friendly and 
      eco-tolerable alternative. But they have got certain limitations as well, such as 
      high cost of production and unsatisfactory mechanical properties. In this study we 
      have found agriculture waste (AW) as low-cost and renewable substrate for the 
      production of bioplastics in bacterial fermentation. Improvement in tensile 
      properties of produced bioplastic film has also been documented upon blending with 
      Cellulose Acetate Butyrate (CAB).

AB  - p-Benzoquinone (BQ) is a lignin-derived inhibitor to microbial strains. Unlike the 
      furan inhibitors, p-benzoquinone is recalcitrant to traditional detoxification 
      methods. This study shows a biological degradation of p-benzoquinone and a 
      simultaneous D-lactic acid fermentation by an engineered Pediococcus acidilactici 
      strain. The overexpression of an oxidoreductase gene ZMO1116 from Zymomonas mobilis 
      encoding oxidoreductase was identified to improve the D-lactic acid fermentability 
      of P. acidilactici against p-benzoquinone. The gene ZMO1116 was integrated into the 
      genome of P. acidilactici and enabled the engineered P. acidilactici to convert 
      p-benzoquinone into less toxic hydroquinone (HQ), resulting in the improved 
      p-benzoquinone tolerance. Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) 
      was conducted using the pretreated and biodetoxified corn stover containing 
      p-benzoquinone, the D-lactic acid production of the engineered strain (123.8 g/L) 
      was 21.4 % higher than the parental strain (102.0 g/L). This study provides a 
      practical method on robust p-benzoquinone tolerance and efficient cellulosic chiral 
      lactic acid fermentation from lignocellulose feedstock.

TI  - Biodegradation of kraft lignin by a newly isolated anaerobic bacterial strain, 
      Acetoanaerobium sp. WJDL-Y2.
PG  - 55-62
LID - 10.1111/lam.12508 [doi]
AB  - An anaerobic kraft lignin (KL)-degrading bacterial strain was isolated from sludge 
      of a pulp and paper mill. It was characterized as Acetoanaerobium sp. WJDL-Y2 by 16S 
      rRNA gene sequencing. The maximum KL degradation capability of strain Y2 was 
      determined to be 24·9% on a COD basis under an optimal condition with temperature of 
      31·5°C, initial pH of 6·8 and KL to nitrogen (as NH4 Cl) ratio of 6·5 by mass. 
      Growth kinetic studies showed that the KL tolerance of strain Y2 was relatively high 
      (Ki  = 8120·45 mg l(-1) ). Analysing KL degradation products by GC-MS revealed the 
      formation of low-molecular-weight aromatic compounds (LMWACs), including 
      benzene-propanoic acid, syringic acid and ferulic acid. This indicates that strain 
      Y2 can oxidize lignin structure's p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units, guaiacyl (G) units and 
      syringyl (S). In addition, the inoculated sample also contained low-molecular acid 
      compounds, such as hexanoic acid, adipic acid and 2-hydroxybutyric acid, further 
      validating strain Y2's ability to degrade KL. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: 
      Kraft lignin containing effluents discharged from pulp and paper industries causes 
      serious environmental pollution in developing countries. Due to the immense 
      environmental adaptability and biochemical versatility, bacterial ligninolytic 
      potential deserve to be studied for application in effluent treatment of pulp and 
      paper industry. In this study, an anaerobic lignin-degrading bacterium, 
      Acetoanaerobium sp. WJDL-Y2 (accession no. KF176997),was isolated from the sludge of 
      a pulp and paper mill. Strain Y2 can play an important role in treating pulp and 
      paper wastewater, as well as breaking down materials for biofuel and chemical 
      production.

AB  - In this study, a high-throughput sequencing approach was applied to discover novel 
      biocatalysts for lignocellulose hydrolysis from three dedicated energy crops, Arundo 
      donax, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Populus nigra, after natural biodegradation. The 
      microbiomes of the three lignocellulosic biomasses were dominated by bacterial 
      species (approximately 90%) with the highest representation by the Streptomyces 
      genus both in the total microbial community composition and in the microbial 
      diversity related to GH families of predicted ORFs. Moreover, the functional 
      clustering of the predicted ORFs showed a prevalence of poorly characterized genes, 
      suggesting these lignocellulosic biomasses are potential sources of as yet unknown 
      genes. 1.2%, 0.6% and 3.4% of the total ORFs detected in A. donax, E. camaldulensis 
      and P. nigra, respectively, were putative Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZymes). 
      Interestingly, the glycoside hydrolases abundance in P. nigra (1.8%) was higher than 
      that detected in the other biomasses investigated in this study. Moreover, a high 
      percentage of (hemi)cellulases with different activities and accessory enzymes 
      (mannanases, polygalacturonases and feruloyl esterases) was detected, confirming 
      that the three analyzed samples were a reservoir of diversified biocatalysts 
      required for an effective lignocellulose saccharification.

AB  - Retting of bast fibres requires removal of pectin, hemicellulose and other 
      non-cellulosic materials from plant stem tissues by a complex microbial community. A 
      microbial retting consortium with high-efficiency pectinolytic bacterial strains is 
      effective in reducing retting-time and enhancing fibre quality. We report 
      comprehensive genomic analyses of three bacterial strains (PJRB 1, 2 and 3) of the 
      consortium and resolve their taxonomic status, genomic features, variations, and 
      pan-genome dynamics. The genome sizes of the strains are ~3.8 Mb with 3729 to 4002 
      protein-coding genes. Detailed annotations of the protein-coding genes revealed 
      different carbohydrate-degrading CAZy classes viz. PL1, PL9, GH28, CE8, and CE12. 
      Phylogeny and structural features of pectate lyase proteins of PJRB strains divulge 
      their functional uniqueness and evolutionary convergence with closely related 
      Bacillus strains. Genome-wide prediction of genomic variations revealed 12461 to 
      67381 SNPs, and notably many unique SNPs were localized within the important pectin 
      metabolism genes. The variations in the pectate lyase genes possibly contribute to 
      their specialized pectinolytic function during the retting process. These findings 
      encompass a strong foundation for fundamental and evolutionary studies on this 
      unique microbial degradation of decaying plant material with immense industrial 
      significance. These have preponderant implications in plant biomass research and 
      food industry, and also posit application in the reclamation of water pollution from 
      plant materials.

AB  - In this work, spent mushroom substrates were utilized for screening a microbial 
      consortium with highly simultaneous degradation of lignocellulose and chlorophenols. 
      The desired microbial consortium OEM1 was gained through successive cultivation for 
      about 50 generations and its stability of composition was verified by denaturing 
      gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) during screening process. It could degrade 
      lignocellulose and chlorophenols at around 50% and 100%, respectively, within 7days. 
      The diversity analysis and the growth characteristics of OEM1 during degradation 
      process were investigated by PCR-DGGE combined with clone and sequence. The results 
      indicated that OEM1 consisted of 31 strains. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were 
      the predominant bacterial groups. The dynamic change of OEM1 illustrated that 
      consortium community structure was effected by pH and substrate alteration and 
      tended to be stable after 6days' cultivation. Furthermore, bacteria (11 strains) and 
      actinomycetes (2 strains) were obtained based on plate isolation and identified via 
      16S rDNA sequence.

      at El Fraile, Mexico.

AB  - Mine tailings contain high concentrations of heavy metals such as As, Pb, Cu, Mn, 
      and Fe, which are detrimental to the health of humans and the environment. In 
      tailings at the El Fraile mine in Guerrero, Mexico, some plant species are 
      apparently tolerant of heavy metals and can be found growing in the tailings. These 
      plants could be associating with heavy metal-tolerant bacteria that promote plant 
      growth and improve biomass production, and these bacteria could be a useful 
      alternative for bacteria-assisted phytoremediation. The objective of this study was 
      to isolate bacteria detected in the mine tailings at El Fraile-Taxco, focusing on 
      those in the soil from the rhizosphere, the inner tissue of the root, leachate, and 
      water, which have the potential to promote plant growth. The ability of the isolated 
      bacteria to promote plant growth was evaluated in vitro. Of the 151 morphotypes 
      isolated, 51% fix nitrogen, 12% dissolve phosphates, and 12%, 39.7%, and 48.3% 
      produce indole acetic acid, gibberellins, and siderophores, respectively. In 
      addition, 66.7% were observed to produce lytic enzymes, such as proteases, 
      celluloses, lipases, esterases, and amylases, which exhibited activity against 
      Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Colletotrichum. The use of 16S rRNA analysis led to the 
      identification of the bacterial genera Chryseobacterium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, 
      Mycobacterium, Staphylococcus, Curtobacterium, Enterobacter, Agrobacterium, 
      Ochrobactrum, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, and Acinetobacter. The bacteria isolated 
      from the rhizosphere exhibited the greatest ability to fix nitrogen and produced 
      indole acetic acid, gibberellins, siderophore, and lytic enzymes. In addition, the 
      isolates collected from the soil samples demonstrated ability to solubilize 
      phosphate.

AB  - In the present study, maize stover was vermicomposted with the epigeic earthworm 
      Eisenia fetida. The results showed that, during vermicomposting process, the 
      earthworms promoted decomposition of maize stover. Analysis of microbial communities 
      of the vermicompost by high-throughput pyrosequencing showed more complex bacterial 
      community structure in the substrate treated by the earthworms than that in the 
      control group. The dominant microbial genera in the treatment with the earthworms 
      were Pseudoxanthomonas, Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Streptomyces, Cryptococcus, 
      Guehomyces, and Mucor. Compared to the control group, the relative abundance of 
      lignocellulose degradation microorganisms increased. The results indicated that the 
      earthworms modified the structure of microbial communities during vermicomposting 
      process, activated the growth of lignocellulose degradation microorganisms, and 
      triggered the lignocellulose decomposition.

AB  - In this research, biodegradation of hexadecane as a model contaminant in solid soil 
      using both free and immobilized Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, capable of producing 
      biosurfactant, was investigated. Coconut fibers in three mesh sizes were used as a 
      cellulosic biocarrier for immobilization procedure. Bioremediation experiments were 
      monitored for 60 days after incubation at 27 °C in small columns, containing 
      contaminated solid soil, with the capability of aeration from bottom to top. The 
      difference in the number of immobilized bacteria cells on the fibers with different 
      particle sizes, emphasizes the importance of choosing an optimized carrier size. 
      Enhancement in hexadecane degradation up to 50 % at the end of experiments was 
      achieved by immobilized Pseudomonas Aeruginosa on the fibers with a mesh size 
      between 8 and 16 compared to inoculation of free bacteria cells into the soil. 
      Effect of mixing the pretreated fibers with soil and inoculating free cells into 
      this mixture was also investigated compared to free cell experiments without fiber, 
      which led to 28 % decrease in hexadecane degradation. Obtained kinetic equations for 
      experiments confirm the impact of immobilization of bacteria on the enhancement of 
      biodegradation rate and reduction of the half-life of the contaminant is soil.

TI  - Surface association of motile bacteria at granular porous media interfaces.
PG  - 3712-9
AB  - Bacterial populations were observed using dark-field light scattering at porous 
      media interfaces comprised of a dilute solution containing the polymer additives 
      methylcellulose and a transparent particulate suspension composed of mechanically 
      agitated Gelrite gellan gum. Population-scale experiments with a nonchemotactic 
      smooth-swimming mutant, Escherichia col HCB 437, yielded a variety of distinct and 
      reproducible bacterial distributions that included highly concentrated bands of 
      bacteria near the interface. While no physical attachment was observed between the 
      bacteria and granular Gelrite media, the population exhibited surface associations 
      characterized by reversible physical obstructions of the motile bacteria at the 
      solid granular surfaces. These interactions decreased translational motion, which 
      reduced bacterial migration and concentrated bacterial populations near the 
      interface. Results from glass bead experiments indicated similar surface 
      associations in high-surface area glass bead environments. Experimental results were 
      semiquantitatively analyzed using a one-dimensional population-scale transport 
      model. Theoretical profiles were generated using a single set of parameters and 
      simultaneously compared with averaged bacterial distributions from multiple 
      interface configurations. Parameter estimates were consistent with expected values. 
      The agreement between the theoretical and experimental data suggests a quantifiable 
      approach for modeling bacterial migration within high-surface area granular media 
      environments.

TI  - Behavior of cellulose-degrading bacteria in thermophilic anaerobic digestion 
      process.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - Previously, we found that the newly isolated Clostridium sp. strain JC3 became the 
      dominant cellulose-degrading bacterium in thermophilic methanogenic sludge. In the 
      present study, the behavior of strain JC3 in the thermophilic anaerobic digestion 
      process was investigated quantitatively by molecular biological techniques. A 
      cellulose-degrading experiment was conducted at 55 degrees C with a 9.5 L of 
      anaerobic baffled reactor having three compartments (Nos. 1, 2, 3). Over 80% of the 
      COD input was converted into methane when 2.5 kgCOD m(-3) d(-1) was loaded for an 
      HRT of 27 days. A FISH probe specific for strain JC3 was applied to sludge samples 
      harvested from the baffled reactor. Consequently, the ratio of JC3 cells to 
      DAPI-stained cells increased from below 0.5% (undetectable) to 9.4% (compartment 1), 
      13.1% (compartment 2) and 21.6% (compartment 3) at day 84 (2.5 kgCOD m(-3)d(-1)). 
      The strain JC3 cell numbers determined by FISH correlated closely with the 
      cellulose-degrading methanogenic activities of retained sludge. A specific primer 
      set targeting the cellulase gene (cellobiohydrolaseA: cbhA) of strain JC3 was 
      designed and applied to digested sludge for treating solid waste such as coffee 
      grounds, wastepaper, garbage, cellulose and so on. The strain JC3 cell numbers 
      determined by quantitative PCR correlated closely with the cellulose-sludge loading 
      of the thermophilic digester. Strain JC3 is thus important in the anaerobic 
      hydrolysis of cellulose in thermophilic anaerobic digestion processes.

AB  - The generation of a complex microbial consortium is a promising approach for 
      efficient biomass decomposition. An anaerobic thermophilic alkaliphilic microbial 
      consortium with efficient degradation ability was screened from bovine manure 
      compost using non-pretreated milling corn stover (CS) and rice straw (RS). A stable 
      microbial consortium ISHI-3 with high degradation ability for CS and RS was isolated 
      by the roll tube technique. ISHI-3 comprised Herbivorax saccincola and bacteria 
      belonging to the classes Pelotomaculum, Tepidanaerobacter, and Tepidimicrobium, as 
      determined by DGGE of the PCR-generated 16S rRNA genes. Furthermore, metagenomics 
      analysis using a 16S rRNA library was carried out to determine the bacterial 
      distribution during degradation of CS and RS. H. saccincola and bacteria belonging 
      to Pelotomaculum were relatively abundant in the beginning to middle periods of 
      culture with CS and RS whereas bacteria belonging to Tepidanaerobacter and 
      Tepidimicrobium gradually increased in the population during the later stages. To 
      understand the role of non-cellulolytic bacteria in the consortium, novel strains 
      ET1 and GL4, which were most closely related to Tepidimicrobium ferriphilum and 
      Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans, were isolated from ISHI-3. Based on their carbon 
      source usage, morphology, and phylogenetic analysis, we propose that strains ET1 and 
      GL4 should be classified as a novel genus or species. Bacteria ET1 and GL4 can 
      utilize different organic compounds as carbon and energy sources such as organic 
      acids, alcohols, sugars, and amino acids, showing a preference for organic acids and 
      alcohols rather than sugars such as glucose and cellobiose. These results indicated 
      that ET1 and GL4 help to accelerate efficient lignocellulose degradation of H. 
      saccincola.

TI  - Biodegradation of alkali lignin by Bacillus flexus RMWW II: analyzing performance 
      for abatement of rice mill wastewater.
PG  - 1623-1632
LID - 10.2166/wst.2020.005 [doi]
AB  - A potential bacterium Bacillus flexus RMWW II has been isolated from rice mill 
      effluent, and examined for its decolorizing potential for lignin-mimicking dyes. The 
      biodegradation of alkali lignin by the rod-shaped, Gram-positive, oxidase and 
      catalase-positive Bacillus flexus RMWW II bacteria is due to its uptake of lignin as 
      the sole carbon source. The lignin degradation was 100% at a lignin concentration of 
      50 mg L(-1) but the degradation reduced to 20% at 400 mg L(-1). The 
      bacterial-mediated biodegradation of alkali lignin was suitably explained by the 
      Edward kinetics model with a maximal specific biodegradation rate (q(max)) of 0.056 
      h(-1) and true specific biodegradation rate (q*) of 0.042 h(-1). The non-toxic 
      nature of the metabolites of alkali lignin after bacterial degradation was 
      illustrated by phytotoxicity studies. This bacterium was utilized to treat complex 
      rice mill wastewater, as lignin is one of the major components of the effluent. A 
      considerable reduction of 84% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was observed in a 
      batch reactor in 70 h of operation. The bacterial treatment results for the actual 
      rice mill effluent indicate that Bacillus flexus RMWW II could be a promising agent 
      for microbial remediation of lignin-laden raw rice mill wastewater.

AB  - Lignin is a recalcitrant macromolecule formed by three alcohols (monolignols) 
      predominantly connected by β-aryl ether linkages and is one of the most abundant 
      organic macromolecules in the biosphere. However, the role played by environmental 
      bacteria in lignin degradation is still not entirely understood. In this study, we 
      identified an environmental Klebsiella strain isolated from sediment collected from 
      an altitudinal region in a unique Brazilian biome called Caatinga. This organism can 
      also grow in the presence of kraft lignin as a sole source of carbon and aromatic 
      compounds. We performed whole-genome sequencing and conducted an extensive 
      genome-based metabolic reconstruction to reveal the potential mechanisms used by the 
      bacterium Klebsiella variicola P1CD1 for lignin utilization as a carbon source. We 
      identified 262 genes associated with lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs) and 
      lignin-degrading auxiliary enzymes (LDAs) required for lignin and aromatic compound 
      degradation. The presence of one DyP (Dye-decolorizing Peroxidase) gene suggests the 
      ability of P1CD1 strain to access phenolic and nonphenolic structures of lignin 
      molecules, resulting in the production of catechol and protocatechuate (via vanillin 
      or syringate) along the peripheral pathways of lignin degradation. K. variicola 
      P1CD1 uses aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase to perform direct conversion of vanillin 
      to protocatechol. The upper funneling pathways are linked to the central pathways of 
      the protocatechuate/catechol catabolic branches via β-ketoadipate pathways, 
      connecting the more abundant catabolized aromatic compounds with essential cellular 
      functions, such as energy cellular and biomass production (i.e., via acetyl-CoA 
      formation). The combination of phenotypic and genomic approaches revealed the 
      potential dissimilatory and assimilatory ability of K. variicola P1CD1 to perform 
      base-catalyzed lignin degradation, acting on high- and low-molecular-weight lignin 
      fragments. These findings will be relevant for developing metabolic models to 
      predict the ligninolytic mechanism used by environmental bacteria and shedding light 
      on the flux of carbon in the soil.

AB  - In this study, we identified five strains isolated from soil and sediments able to 
      degrade kraft lignin, aromatic dyes and lignin derivatives. Using 16S rRNA gene 
      sequencing, the isolates were identified as Serratia sp. JHT01, Serratia liquefacien 
      PT01, Pseudomonas chlororaphis PT02, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia PT03 and 
      Mesorhizobium sp. PT04. All the isolates showed significant growth on lignin with no 
      water-extractable compounds. Synthetic aromatic dyes were used to assess the 
      presence of oxidative enzymes. All the isolates were able to use the thiazine dye 
      Methylene blue and the anthraquinone dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R as the sole carbon 
      source. Guaiacol, veratryl alcohol and biphenyl were also mineralized by all the 
      strains isolated. These results suggest they could be used for the treatment of 
      aromatic pollutants and for the degradation of the lignocellulosic biomass. 
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The valorization of waste lignin and 
      lignocellulosic biomass by biocatalysis opens up new possibilities for the 
      production of value-added substituted aromatics, biofuel and for the treatment of 
      aromatic pollutants. Bacteria with ligninolytic potential could be a source of novel 
      enzymes for controlled lignin depolymerization. In this work, five soil bacteria 
      were isolated and studied. Every isolate showed significant growth on lignin and was 
      able to degrade several lignin monomers and ligninolytic indicator dyes. They could 
      thus be a source of novel ligninolytic enzymes as well as candidates for a bacterial 
      consortium for the delignification of lignocellulosic biomass.

TI  - Biodegradation of Lignin Monomers Vanillic, p-Coumaric, and Syringic Acid by the 
      Bacterial Strain, Sphingobacterium sp. HY-H.
PG  - 1156-1164
LID - 10.1007/s00284-018-1504-2 [doi]
AB  - Many bacterial strains have been demonstrated to biodegrade lignin for contaminant 
      removal or resource regeneration. The goal of this study was to investigate the 
      biodegradation amount and associated pathways of three lignin monomers, vanillic, 
      p-coumaric, and syringic acid by strain Sphingobacterium sp. HY-H. Vanillic, 
      p-coumaric, and syringic acid degradation with strain HY-H was estimated as 88.71, 
      76.67, and 72.78%, respectively, after 96 h. Correspondingly, the same three 
      monomers were associated with a COD removal efficiency of 87.30, 55.17, and 67.23%, 
      and a TOC removal efficiency of 82.14, 61.03, and 43.86%. The results of GC-MS, 
      HPLC, FTIR, and enzyme activities show that guaiacol and o-dihydroxybenzene are key 
      intermediate metabolites of the vanillic acid and syringic acid degradation. 
      p-Hydroxybenzoic acid is an important intermediate metabolite for p-coumaric and 
      syringic acid degradation. LiP and MnP play an important role in the degradation of 
      lignin monomers and their intermediate metabolites. One possible pathway is that 
      strain HY-H degrades lignin monomers into guaiacol (through decarboxylic and 
      demethoxy reaction) or p-hydroxybenzoic acid (through side-chain oxidation); then 
      guaiacol demethylates to o-dihydroxybenzene. The p-hydroxybenzoic acid and 
      o-dihydroxybenzene are futher through ring cleavage reaction to form small molecule 
      acids (butyric, valproic, oxalic acid, and propionic acid) and alcohols (ethanol and 
      ethanediol), then these acids and alcohols are finally decomposed into CO(2) and 
      H(2)O through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. If properly optimized and controlled, 
      the strain HY-H may play a role in breaking down lignin-related compounds for 
      biofuel and chemical production.

TI  - Ecology of coarse wood decomposition by the saprotrophic fungus Fomes fomentarius.
PG  - 709-18
LID - 10.1007/s10532-010-9390-8 [doi]
AB  - Saprotrophic wood-inhabiting basidiomycetes are the most important decomposers of 
      lignin and cellulose in dead wood and as such they attracted considerable attention. 
      The aims of this work were to quantify the activity and spatial distribution of 
      extracellular enzymes in coarse wood colonised by the white-rot basidiomycete Fomes 
      fomentarius and in adjacent fruitbodies of the fungus and to analyse the diversity 
      of the fungal and bacterial community in a fungus-colonised wood and its potential 
      effect on enzyme production by F. fomentarius. Fungus-colonised wood and fruitbodies 
      were collected in low management intensity forests in the Czech Republic. There were 
      significant differences in enzyme production by F. fomentarius between Betula 
      pendula and Fagus sylvatica wood, the activity of cellulose and xylan-degrading 
      enzymes was significantly higher in beech wood than in birch wood. Spatial analysis 
      of a sample B. pendula log segment proved that F. fomentarius was the single fungal 
      representative found in the log. There was a high level of spatial variability in 
      the amount of fungal biomass detected, but no effects on enzyme activities were 
      observed. Samples from the fruiting body showed high β-glucosidase and chitinase 
      activities compared to wood samples. Significantly higher levels of xylanase and 
      cellobiohydrolase were found in samples located near the fruitbody (proximal), and 
      higher laccase and Mn-peroxidase activities were found in the distal ones. The 
      microbial community in wood was dominated by the fungus (fungal to bacterial DNA 
      ratio of 62-111). Bacterial abundance composition was lower in proximal than distal 
      parts of wood by a factor of 24. These results show a significant level of spatial 
      heterogeneity in coarse wood. One of the explanations may be the successive 
      colonization of wood by the fungus: due to differential enzyme production, the rates 
      of biodegradation of coarse wood are also spatially inhomogeneous.

AB  - AIMS: To develop a method to detect bacteria from environmental samples that are 
      able to metabolize lignin. METHODS AND RESULTS: A previously developed UV-vis assay 
      method for lignin degradation activity has been developed for use as a spray assay 
      on agar plates. Nine mesophilic strains were isolated using this method from 
      woodland soil incubated in enrichment cultures containing wheat straw 
      lignocellulose: four Microbacterium isolates, two Micrococcus isolates, Rhodococcus 
      erythropolis (all Actinobacteria) and two Ochrobactrum isolates 
      (Alphaproteobacteria). Three thermotolerant isolates were isolated from the same 
      screening method applied at 45°C to samples of composted wheat straw from 
      solid-state fermentation: Thermobifida fusca and two isolates related to 
      uncharacterized species of Rhizobiales and Sphingobacterium (Bacteroidetes), the 
      latter strain showing tenfold higher lignin degradation activity than other 
      isolates. The isolated strains were able to depolymerize samples of 
      size-fractionated high molecular weight and low molecular weight Kraft lignin, and 
      produced low molecular weight metabolites oxalic acid and protocatechuic acid from 
      incubations containing wheat straw lignocellulose. CONCLUSIONS: A new method for the 
      isolation of bacteria able to metabolize lignin has been developed, which has been 
      used to identify 12 bacterial isolates from environmental sources. The majority of 
      isolates cluster into the Actinobacteria and the Alphaproteobacteria. SIGNIFICANCE 
      AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Lignin-degrading bacterial strains could be used to convert 
      lignin-containing feedstocks into renewable chemicals and to identify new bacterial 
      lignin-degrading enzymes.

AB  - Bioaugmentation with hydrolytic microbes was applied to improve the methane yield of 
      bioreactors fed with agricultural wastes. The efficiency of Clostridium thermocellum 
      and Melioribacter roseus to degrade lignocellulosic matter was evaluated in batch 
      and continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). Results from batch assays showed 
      that C. thermocellum enhanced the methane yield by 34%. A similar increase was 
      recorded in CSTR during the bioaugmentation period; however, at steady-state the 
      effect was noticeably lower (7.5%). In contrast, the bioaugmentation with M. roseus 
      did not promote markedly the anaerobic biodegradability, as the methane yield was 
      increased up to 10% in batch and no effect was shown in CSTR. High-throughput 16S 
      rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to assess the effect of bioaugmentation strategies 
      on bacterial and archaeal populations. The microbial analysis revealed that both 
      strains were not markedly resided into biogas microbiome. Additionally, the applied 
      strategies did not alter significantly the microbial communities.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass was submitted to a biological pretreatment prior to a 
      catalytic hydroliquefaction in order to produce biofuel. The biodegradation process 
      was conducted over 3 months in a reactor under controlled conditions. During the 
      biodegradation process the organic matter was characterised and its evolution was 
      correlated with physico-chemical parameters. In parallel with the analysis of the 
      lipidic fraction, analytical pyrolysis was used to monitor bacterial activity. The 
      alterations of branched to linear fatty acids ratio and of mono- to diacids ratio 
      were compared when determined by thermochemolysis and observed in the directly 
      extractable lipids. The evolution of the phytol to the corresponding isoprenoic 
      ketone ratio was observed to be dependent on the desorption technique since it 
      decreases using headspace while it increases using pyrolysis. "Humic"/"fulvic acids" 
      ratio, infrared spectroscopy and thermodifferential analysis were used to determine 
      the degree of OM complexification.

AB  - Supramolecular cross-linked porous lignin based poly (acrylic acid) [LBPAA] was 
      lab-synthesized by copolymerizing lignin grafted N, N'-methylene-bisacrylamide (LM) 
      and acrylic acid. LBPAA successfully acted as a water retention agent with salt 
      resistance and biodegradation for agricultural applications. Lignin was found to 
      improve its swelling behaviors with higher water retention, fast swelling and 
      de-swelling rates. The salt tolerance was stronger in the case of LBPAA 
      (60 PAA/40 LM) [60 wt% PAA/40 wt% LM], i.e., 145.79 g·g(-1) higher than PAA at 
      0.09 mM KCl solution. The effect of ion charges on the LBPAA swelling ratio was 
      greater than that of ionic radius. The weight loss of LBPAA (60 PAA/40 LM) was 
      5.47%, 4.96%, and 4.56% in the soil of Tangshan, Harbin, and Sian, respectively. The 
      soil moisture content and clay content were observed to decrease gradually with 
      increasing the burial time. The biodegradation test of LBPAA (60 PAA/40 LM) 
      composite exhibited different bacterial colony forming units (CFU), the soil of 
      Tangshan was 2.0 × 10(3) CFU·g(-1) soil, 7.0 × 10(3) CFU·g(-1) soil for Harbin, and 
      6.10 × 10(4) CFU·g(-1) soil for Sian. However, the organic matter contents in the 
      soils did not have significant changes (Tangshan 6.21 mg·g(-1), Harbin 
      0.61 mg·g(-1), and Sian 0.405 mg·g(-1)).

AB  - Succession of communities of different bacteria and fungi, mainly proteolytic and 
      keratinolytic ones, was observed during composting of chicken feathers with pine 
      bark (FB) and with pine bark/rye straw (FBS). The succession was dominated by fungal 
      than bacterial communities. Bacteria, including Actinomycetes, grew intensively 
      during the first 2-4 weeks of composting and included mainly proteolytic, rarely 
      cellulolytic, populations; afterwards, bacteria were gradually replaced by fungi. 
      Meso- and thermophilic ubiquitous fungi, including cellulolytic ones, appeared among 
      fungal representatives as the first, while keratinolytic strains were detected in 
      the compost biomass at the 6th week of the process. The development of strains 
      within the second fungal group was significantly more intensive than that of 
      cellulolytic populations. The intensity of growth of particular 
      ecological-physiological communities was found to be dependent on chemical content 
      and C/N ratio of biomass and was the strongest in C/N=25 composts.

AB  - Composting is a promising source of new organisms and thermostable enzymes that may 
      be helpful in environmental management and industrial processes. Here we present 
      results of metagenomic- and metatranscriptomic-based analyses of a large composting 
      operation in the São Paulo Zoo Park. This composting exhibits a sustained 
      thermophilic profile (50 °C to 75 °C), which seems to preclude fungal activity. The 
      main novelty of our study is the combination of time-series sampling with shotgun 
      DNA, 16S rRNA gene amplicon, and metatranscriptome high-throughput sequencing, 
      enabling an unprecedented detailed view of microbial community structure, dynamics, 
      and function in this ecosystem. The time-series data showed that the turning 
      procedure has a strong impact on the compost microbiota, restoring to a certain 
      extent the population profile seen at the beginning of the process; and that 
      lignocellulosic biomass deconstruction occurs synergistically and sequentially, with 
      hemicellulose being degraded preferentially to cellulose and lignin. Moreover, our 
      sequencing data allowed near-complete genome reconstruction of five bacterial 
      species previously found in biomass-degrading environments and of a novel 
      biodegrading bacterial species, likely a new genus in the order Bacillales. The data 
      and analyses provided are a rich source for additional investigations of 
      thermophilic composting microbiology.

TI  - Activated zeolite--suitable carriers for microorganisms in anaerobic digestion 
      processes?
PG  - 3225-38
LID - 10.1007/s00253-013-4691-6 [doi]
AB  - Plant cell wall structures represent a barrier in the biodegradation process to 
      produce biogas for combustion and energy production. Consequently, approaches 
      concerning a more efficient de-polymerisation of cellulose and hemicellulose to 
      monomeric sugars are required. Here, we show that natural activated zeolites (i.e. 
      trace metal activated zeolites) represent eminently suitable mineral microhabitats 
      and potential carriers for immobilisation of microorganisms responsible for 
      anaerobic hydrolysis of biopolymers stabilising related bacterial and methanogenic 
      communities. A strategy for comprehensive analysis of immobilised anaerobic 
      populations was developed that includes the visualisation of biofilm formation via 
      scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, community and 
      fingerprint analysis as well as enzyme activity and identification analyses. Using 
      SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, hydrolytical active protein bands were 
      traced by congo red staining. Liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy revealed 
      cellulolytical endo- and exoglucanase (exocellobiohydrolase) as well as 
      hemicellulolytical xylanase/mannase after proteolytic digestion. Relations to 
      hydrolytic/fermentative zeolite colonisers were obtained by using single-strand 
      conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) based on amplification of bacterial and 
      archaeal 16S rRNA fragments. Thereby, dominant colonisers were affiliated to the 
      genera Clostridium, Pseudomonas and Methanoculleus. The specific immobilisation on 
      natural zeolites with functional microbes already colonising naturally during the 
      fermentation offers a strategy to systematically supply the biogas formation process 
      responsive to population dynamics and process requirements.

TI  - Dynamics of Microbial Populations Responsible for Biodegradation during the 
      Full-Scale Treatment of Palm Oil Mill Effluent.
PG  - 121-128
LID - 10.1264/jsme2.ME18104 [doi]
AB  - Despite efforts to address the composition of the microbial community during the 
      anaerobic treatment of palm oil mill effluent (POME), its composition in relation to 
      biodegradation in the full-scale treatment system has not yet been extensively 
      examined. Therefore, a thorough analysis of bacterial and archaeal communities was 
      performed in the present study using MiSeq sequencing at the different stages of the 
      POME treatment, which comprised anaerobic as well as facultative anaerobic and 
      aerobic processes, including the mixed raw effluent (MRE), mixing pond, holding 
      tank, and final discharge phases. Based on the results obtained, the following 
      biodegradation processes were suggested to occur at the different treatment stages: 
      (1) Lactobacillaceae (35.9%) dominated the first stage, which contributed to high 
      lactic acid production; (2) the higher population of Clostridiaceae in the mixing 
      pond (47.7%) and Prevotellaceae in the holding tank (49.7%) promoted acetic acid 
      production; (3) the aceticlastic methanogen Methanosaetaceae (0.6-0.8%) played a 
      role in acetic acid degradation in the open digester and closed reactor for methane 
      generation; (4) Syntrophomonas (21.5-29.2%) appeared to be involved in the 
      degradation of fatty acids and acetic acid by syntrophic cooperation with the 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanobacteriaceae (0.6-1.3%); and (5) the phenols and 
      alcohols detected in the early phases, but not in the final discharge phase, 
      indicated the successful degradation of lignocellulosic materials. The present 
      results contribute to a better understanding of the biodegradation mechanisms

      of phenolic compounds in repeated batch process.
PG  - 148-53
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.09.026 [doi]
AB  - Delftia tsuruhatensis BM90, previously isolated from Tyrrhenian Sea and selected for 
      its ability to degrade a wide array of phenolic compounds, was immobilized in 
      chemically modified macro porous cellulose. The development of bacterial adhesion on 
      the selected carrier was monitored by scanning electron microscopy. Evident 
      colonization started already after 8h of incubation. After 72h, almost all the 
      carrier surface was covered by the bacterial cells. Extracellular bacterial 
      structures, such as pili or fimbriae, contributed to carrier colonization and cell 
      attachment. Immobilized cells of D. tsuruhatensis were tested for their ability to 
      biodegrade a pool of 20 phenols in repeated batch process. During the first 
      activation batch (72h), 90% of phenols degradation was obtained already in 48h. In 
      the subsequent batches (up to 360h), same degradation was obtained after 24h only. 
      By contrast, free cells were slower: to obtain almost same degradation, 48h were 
      needed. Thus, process productivity, achieved by the immobilized cells, was double 
      than that of free cells. Specific activity was also higher suggesting that the use 
      of immobilized D. tsuruhatensis BM90 could be considered very promising in order to 
      obtain an efficient reusable biocatalyst for long-term treatment of phenols 
      containing effluents.

AB  - Composting is an appropriate management alternative for municipal solid waste; 
      however, our knowledge about the microbial regulation of this process is still 
      scare. We employed metaproteomics to elucidate the main biodegradation pathways in 
      municipal solid waste composting system across the main phases in a large-scale 
      composting plant. The investigation of microbial succession revealed that 
      Bacillales, Actinobacteria and Saccharomyces increased significantly with respect to 
      abundance in composting process. The key microbiologic population for cellulose 
      degradation in different composting stages was different. Fungi were found to be the 
      main producers of cellulase in earlier phase. However, the cellulolytic fungal 
      communities were gradually replaced by a purely bacterial one in active phase, which 
      did not support the concept that the thermophilic fungi are active through the 
      thermophilic phase. The effective decomposition of cellulose required the synergy 
      between bacteria and fungi in the curing phase.

AB  - Four cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacterial cultures were purchased from the 
      Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Culture (DSMZ) 
      and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Two experiments were conducted; the 
      objective of the first experiment was to determine the optimum time period required 
      for solid state fermentation (SSF) of palm kernel cake (PKC), whereas the objective 
      of the second experiment was to investigate the effect of combinations of these 
      cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria on the nutritive quality of the PKC. In 
      the first experiment, the SSF was lasted for 12 days with inoculum size of 10% (v/w) 
      on different PKC to moisture ratios. In the second experiment, fifteen combinations 
      were created among the four microbes with one untreated PKC as a control. The SSF 
      lasted for 9 days, and the samples were autoclaved, dried, and analyzed for 
      proximate analysis. Results showed that bacterial cultures produced high enzymes 
      activities at the 4th day of SSF, whereas their abilities to produce enzymes tended 
      to be decreased to reach zero at the 8th day of SSF. Findings in the second 
      experiment showed that hemicellulose and cellulose was significantly (P < 0.05) 
      decreased, whereas the amount of reducing sugars were significantly (P < 0.05) 
      increased in the fermented PKC (FPKC) compared with untreated PKC.

TI  - Microbial Diversity in Decaying Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunches (OPEFB) and Isolation 
      of Lignin-degrading Bacteria from a Tropical Environment.
PG  - 161-168
LID - 10.1264/jsme2.ME18117 [doi]
AB  - Oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) are the most abundant, inexpensive, and 
      environmentally friendly lignocellulosic biomass in Malaysia. Investigations on the 
      microbial diversity of decaying OPEFB may reveal microbes with complex enzymes that 
      have the potential to enhance the conversion of lignocellulose into 
      second-generation biofuels as well as the production of other value-added products. 
      In the present study, fungal and bacterial diversities in decaying OPEFB were 
      identified using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene and 
      V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene. Fungal diversity in decaying OPEFB was dominated by 
      the phylum Ascomycota (14.43%), while most of the bacterial sequences retrieved 
      belonged to Proteobacteria (76.71%). Three bacterial strains isolated from decaying 
      OPEFB, designated as S18, S20, and S36, appeared to grow with extracted OPEFB-lignin 
      and Kraft lignin (KL) as the sole carbon source. 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 
      the 3 isolates as Paenibacillus sp.. The molecular weight distribution of KL before 
      and after degradation showed significant depolymerization when treated with 
      bacterial strains S18, S20, and S36. The presence of low-molecular-weight 
      lignin-related compounds, such as vanillin and 2-methoxyphenol derivatives, which 
      were detected by a GC-MS analysis, confirmed the KL-degrading activities of isolated 
      Paenibacillus strains.

AB  - The Burkholderia cepacia Complex assembles at least eighteen closely related species 
      that are ubiquitous in nature. Some isolates show beneficial potential for 
      biocontrol, bioremediation and plant growth promotion. On the contrary, other 
      strains are pathogens for plants and immunocompromised individuals, like cystic 
      fibrosis patients. In these subjects, they can cause respiratory tract infections 
      sometimes characterised by fatal outcome. Most of the Burkholderia cepacia Complex 
      species are mucoid when grown on a mannitol rich medium and they also form biofilms, 
      two related characteristics, since polysaccharides are important component of 
      biofilm matrices. Moreover, polysaccharides contribute to bacterial survival in a 
      hostile environment by inhibiting both neutrophils chemotaxis and antimicrobial 
      peptides activity, and by scavenging reactive oxygen species. The ability of these 
      microorganisms to produce exopolysaccharides with different structures is testified 
      by numerous articles in the literature. However, little is known about the type of 
      polysaccharides produced in biofilms and their relationship with those obtained in 
      non-biofilm conditions. The aim of this study was to define the type of 
      exopolysaccharides produced by nine species of the Burkholderia cepacia Complex. Two 
      isolates were then selected to compare the polysaccharides produced on agar plates 
      with those formed in biofilms developed on cellulose membranes. The investigation 
      was conducted using NMR spectroscopy, high performance size exclusion 
      chromatography, and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The results 
      showed that the Complex is capable of producing a variety of exopolysaccharides, 
      most often in mixture, and that the most common exopolysaccharide is always 
      cepacian. In addition, two novel polysaccharide structures were determined: one 
      composed of mannose and rhamnose and another containing galactose and glucuronic 
      acid. Comparison of exopolysaccharides obtained from cultures on agar plates with 
      those extracted from biofilms on cellulose membranes showed important differences, 
      thus suggesting that extrapolating data from non-biofilm conditions might not always 
      be applicable.

AB  - This microbiological survey was performed to determine the conservation state of a 
      mummy in the Slovak castle of Krásna Hôrka and its surrounding environment. 
      Culture-dependent identification was coupled with biodegradation assays on keratin, 
      gelatin and cellulose. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using Illumina platform was 
      used for a deeper microbial investigation. Three environmental samples were 
      collected: from the glass of the sarcophagus, from the air inside it, and from the 
      air of the chapel where the mummy is located. Seven different samples were taken 
      from mummy's surface: from the left ear, left-hand palm, left-hand nail, left 
      instep, right hand, abdomen and mineral crystals embedded within the skin. Three 
      internal organ samples, from the lung, pleura and stomach, were also included in 
      this study. Together, the culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses 
      revealed that the bacterial communities present had fewer taxa than the fungal ones. 
      The mycobiome showed the largest variability and included Epicoccum nigrum, 
      Penicillium spp., Alternaria spp., Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium spp. and 
      Aureobasidium pullulans; many other Ascomycota and Basidiomycota genera were 
      detected by NGS. The most interesting results came from the skin mineral crystals 
      and the internal organs. The hydrolytic assays revealed those microorganisms which 
      might be considered dangerous 'mummy pathogens'. © 2018 Society for Applied

TI  - Enhancement of microbial diversity and methane yield by bacterial bioaugmentation 
      through the anaerobic digestion of Haematococcus pluvialis.
PG  - 5631-7
LID - 10.1007/s00253-016-7501-0 [doi]
AB  - Microalgae has recalcitrant cell walls that may limit digestibility and, therefore, 
      reduce bioenergy production. In light of the fact that cellulose can increase the 
      cell wall recalcitrance of the Haematococcus pluvialis species of microalgae, the 
      objective of this research was to examine how bioaugmentation with the Clostridium 
      thermocellum at various inoculum ratios represents a viable method by which the CH4 
      production of microalgae can be enhanced. The results of the investigation revealed 
      that bioaugmentation with C. thermocellum increased the degradation of H. pluvialis 
      biomass and resulted in a 18-38 % increase in methane production as a result of 
      increased cell disruption. In addition, the use of Illumina Miseq sequencing 
      highlighted that the bacterial and archaeal diversity and quantities in the genus 
      were enhanced as a result of the addition of C. thermocellum and this, in itself, 
      improved the efficiency of the biodegradation. Bioaugmentation with C. thermocellum 
      (%15) was also determined to represent the most energy-efficiency method of 
      producing methane.

TI  - Carbon Source-Dependent Inducible Metabolism of Veratryl Alcohol and Ferulic Acid in 
      Pseudomonas putida CSV86.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03326-16 [doi]
LID - e03326-16
AB  - Pseudomonas putida CSV86 degrades lignin-derived metabolic intermediates, viz, 
      veratryl alcohol, ferulic acid, vanillin, and vanillic acid, as the sole sources of 
      carbon and energy. Strain CSV86 also degraded lignin sulfonate. Cell respiration, 
      enzyme activity, biotransformation, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
      analyses suggest that veratryl alcohol and ferulic acid are metabolized to vanillic 
      acid by two distinct carbon source-dependent inducible pathways. Vanillic acid was 
      further metabolized to protocatechuic acid and entered the central carbon pathway 
      via the β-ketoadipate route after ortho ring cleavage. Genes encoding putative 
      enzymes involved in the degradation were found to be present at fer, ver, and van 
      loci. The transcriptional analysis suggests a carbon source-dependent 
      cotranscription of these loci, substantiating the metabolic studies. Biochemical and 
      quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR studies revealed the presence of two distinct 
      O-demethylases, viz, VerAB and VanAB, involved in the oxidative demethylation of 
      veratric acid and vanillic acid, respectively. This report describes the various 
      steps involved in metabolizing lignin-derived aromatic compounds at the biochemical 
      level and identifies the genes involved in degrading veratric acid and the 
      arrangement of phenylpropanoid metabolic genes as three distinct inducible 
      transcription units/operons. This study provides insight into the bacterial 
      degradation of lignin-derived aromatics and the potential of P. putida CSV86 as a 
      suitable candidate for producing valuable products.IMPORTANCEPseudomonas putida 
      CSV86 metabolizes lignin and its metabolic intermediates as a carbon source. Strain 
      CSV86 displays a unique property of preferential utilization of aromatics, including 
      for phenylpropanoids over glucose. This report unravels veratryl alcohol metabolism 
      and genes encoding veratric acid O-demethylase, hitherto unknown in pseudomonads, 
      thereby providing new insight into the metabolic pathway and gene pool for lignin 
      degradation in bacteria. The biochemical and genetic characterization of 
      phenylpropanoid metabolism makes it a prospective system for its application in 
      producing valuable products, such as vanillin and vanillic acid, from 
      lignocellulose. This study supports the immense potential of P. putida CSV86 as a 
      suitable candidate for bioremediation and biorefinery.

AB  - Previously, a unique co-compost produced by composting empty fruit bunch with 
      anaerobic sludge from palm oil mill effluent, which contributed to establishing a 
      zero-emission industry in Malaysia. Little was known about the bacterial functions 
      during the composting process and fertilization capacity of this co-compost. We 
      isolated 100 strains from the co-compost on 7 types of enumeration media and 
      screened 25 strains using in vitro tests for 12 traits, grouping them according to 
      three functions: plant growth promoting (fixation of nitrogen; solubilization of 
      phosphorus, potassium, and silicate; production of 3-indoleacetic acid, ammonia, and 
      siderophore), biocontrolling (production of chitinase and anti-Ganoderma activity), 
      and composting (degradation of lignin, xylan, and cellulose). Using 16S rRNA gene 
      sequence analysis, 25 strains with strong or multi-functional traits were found 
      belong to the genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and 
      Kosakonia. Furthermore, several strains of Citrobacter sedlakii exhibited a plant 
      growth-stimulation in vivo komatsuna plant cultivation test. In addition, we 
      isolated several multifunctional strains; Bacillus tequilensis CE4 (biocontrolling 
      and composting), Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens B3 (plant growth promoting 
      and biocontrolling), and C. sedlakii CESi7 (plant growth promoting and composting). 
      Some bacteria in the co-compost play significant roles during the composting process 
      and plant cultivation after fertilization, and some multifunctional strains have 
      potential for use in accelerating the biodegradation of lignocellulosic biomass, 
      protecting against Ganoderma boninense infection, and increasing the yield of palm 
      oil.

AB  - Disperse dyes are chiefly used by textile industries for the coloration of polyester 
      and cellulose triacetate and their blended fibres. Their extensive use and 
      recalcitrant nature, high tinctorial strength renders the voluminous textile 
      effluents intensively colored and causes environmental concerns. Decolorization of 
      representative members of Dianix CC and Dianix S brands (DyStar Pvt. Ltd.) of 
      disperse dyes were tested with Candida tropicalis and Bacillus firmus isolated 
      respectively from contaminated soil samples and sludge of a domestic sewage drain. 
      While both the cultures efficiently remove color from the aqueous solutions of the 
      dyes, the yeast culture was found to decolorize most of the tested disperse dyes 
      through biotransformation, the bacterial culture showed color removal mainly by 
      adsorption on the cell pellets. Formation of cleavage products such as 
      p-nitroaniline was observed in the case of Dianix Orange E-3R, indicating reductive 
      cleavage of the azo linkage of the dye.

TI  - Cow manure as additive to a DMBR for stable and high-rate digestion of food waste: 
      Performance and microbial community.

AB  - Cow manure (CM) was added to a dynamic membrane bioreactor (DMBR) operated under 
      anaerobic condition for enhancing food waste (FW) digestion for over 300 days with 
      stepwise increase of organic loading rates (OLRs) from 1.07 to 11.9 g COD/L/day. At 
      a FW/CM ratio of 3.5:1 (based on volatile solids), the mixed liquor pH was always 
      above 8.0 and no apparent volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation occurred even at 
      the highest OLR of 11.9 g COD/L/day (hydraulic retention time as 10 days and solid 
      retention time as 15.5 days, correspondingly), indicating a very stable operation 
      condition which resulted in an average CH(4) yield as high as 250 mL/g COD and CH(4) 
      production as high as 2.71 L CH(4)/L/day. The hardly biodegradable organic 
      components, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, were effectively degraded 
      by 78.3%, 58.8%, and 47.5%, respectively. Significantly high anaerobic digestion 
      reaction ratios, especially the hydrolysis ratio which is usually the limiting 
      factor, were calculated based on experimental results. Furthermore, the high 
      lignocellulase contents and coenzyme F(420) levels, along with the decrease of 
      cellulose crystallinity from 72.6% to 16.4% in the feedstock, provided strong 
      evidence of an enhanced biological activity by CM addition. By high-throughput 
      sequencing analysis, more abundant and diverse bacterial, archaeal, and fungal 
      genera were identified from the DMBR sludge. With CM addition, the biodegradation of 
      lignocellulose might have produced sufficient H(2) and CO(2) for the 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as Methanoculleus, Methanomassiliicoccus, and 
      Methanobacterium, which were highly tolerant to ammonium inhibition, and then the 
      elevated ammonium level would have provided high buffering capacity in the DMBR thus 
      ensuring a stable condition for high rate FW digestion and CH(4) production.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To expand on the range of products which can be obtained from 
      lignocellulosic biomass, the lignin component should be utilized as feedstock for 
      value-added chemicals such as substituted aromatics, instead of being incinerated 
      for heat and energy. Enzymes could provide an effective means for lignin 
      depolymerization into products of interest. In this study, soil bacteria were 
      isolated by enrichment on Kraft lignin and evaluated for their ligninolytic 
      potential as a source of novel enzymes for waste lignin valorization. RESULTS: Based 
      on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phenotypic characterization, the organisms were 
      identified as Pandoraea norimbergensis LD001, Pseudomonas sp LD002 and Bacillus sp 
      LD003. The ligninolytic capability of each of these isolates was assessed by growth 
      on high-molecular weight and low-molecular weight lignin fractions, utilization of 
      lignin-associated aromatic monomers and degradation of ligninolytic indicator dyes. 
      Pandoraea norimbergensis LD001 and Pseudomonas sp. LD002 exhibited best growth on 
      lignin fractions, but limited dye-decolourizing capacity. Bacillus sp. LD003, 
      however, showed least efficient growth on lignin fractions but extensive 
      dye-decolourizing capacity, with a particular preference for the recalcitrant 
      phenothiazine dye class (Azure B, Methylene Blue and Toluidene Blue O). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Bacillus sp. LD003 was selected as a promising source of novel types of ligninolytic 
      enzymes. Our observations suggested that lignin mineralization and depolymerization 
      are separate events which place additional challenges on the screening of 
      ligninolytic microorganisms for specific ligninolytic enzymes.

AB  - AIMS: The aim was to obtain evidences for lignin degradation by unicellular 
      bacterium Comamonas sp. B-9. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comamonas sp. B-9 was inoculated 
      into kraft lignin-mineral salt medium (KL-MSM) at pH 7·0 and 30°C for 7 days of 
      incubation. The bacterial growth, chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction, secretion 
      of ligninolytic enzymes and productions of low-molecular-weight compounds revealed 
      that Comamonas sp. B-9 was able to degrade kraft lignin (KL). COD in KL-MSM reduced 
      by 32% after 7 days of incubation. The maximum activities of manganese peroxidase 
      (MnP) of 2903·2 U l(-1) and laccase (Lac) of 1250 U l(-1) were observed at 4th and 
      6th day, respectively. The low-molecular-weight compounds such as ethanediol, 3, 
      5-dimethyl-benzaldehyde and phenethyl alcohol were formed in the degradation of KL 
      by Comamonas sp. B-9 based on GC-MS analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that 
      Comamonas sp. B-9 could utilize KL as a sole carbon source and degrade KL to 
      low-molecular-weight compounds. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Comamonas sp. 
      B-9 may be useful in the utilization and bioconversion of lignin and lignin-derived 
      aromatic compounds in biotechnological applications. Meanwhile, using Comamonas sp. 
      B-9 in treatment of wastewater in pulp and paper industry is a meaningful work.

TI  - Diversity of a mesophilic lignocellulolytic microbial consortium which is useful for 
      enhancement of biogas production.

AB  - A mesophilic lignocellulolytic microbial consortium BYND-5, established by 
      successive subcultivation, was applied to enhance the biogas production. The 
      degradation efficiency of BYND-5 for rice straw was more than 49.0 ± 1.8% after 7 
      days of cultivation at 30°C. Various organic compounds, including acetic acid, 
      propionic acid, butyric acid and glycerin were detected during biodegradation. The 
      diversity analysis of BYND-5 was conducted by ARDRA (Amplified ribosomal DNA 
      restriction analysis) of the 16S rDNA clone library. Results indicated that 
      bacterial groups represented in the clone library were the Firmicutes (5.96%), the 
      Bacteroidetes (40.0%), Deferribacteres (8.94%), Proteobacteria (16.17%), 
      Lentisphaerae (2.13%), Fibrobacteraceae (1.7%), and uncultured bacterium (25.1%). 
      Additionally, the enhancement of biogas yield and methane content was directly 
      related to the pretreatment with BYND-5. The microbial community identified herein 
      is potential candidate consortium for the degradation of waste lignocellulose and 
      enhancement of biogas production under the mesophilic temperature conditions.

TI  - Bacillus aryabhattai BA03: a novel approach to the production of natural value-added 
      compounds.
PG  - 159
LID - 10.1007/s11274-016-2113-5 [doi]
AB  - A strain designated as BA03, with the ability to transform ferulic acid into 
      vanillin and 4-vinylguaiacol, was isolated from contaminated cryovials. The 
      production of natural value-added compounds was dependent on the media employed. The 
      morphological and physiological characteristics of this strain were compared with 
      those of the typical vanillin-producer strain Amycolatopsis sp. ATCC 39116. 
      According to a partial 16S rRNA sequence, we determined that BA03 belonged to 
      Bacillus aryabhattai. In addition, analysis of the results showed that this strain 
      exhibited interesting enzymatic activity, including cellulases, laccases, lipases 
      and pectinases. In light of this, we propose new functions for this multitasking 
      microorganism. We suggest that it may be used for converting lignocellulosic wastes 
      into byproducts with industrial uses, and also for treating disposal residues such 
      as dyes in the textile industry. Hence, the possibility for novel research with B. 
      aryabhattai opens up in the fields of biodegradation and/or revalorization of 
      wastes.

      infantis ATCC 15697.

LID - S0141-0229(14)00188-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.enzmictec.2014.10.001 [doi]
AB  - We here describe a unique β-D-glucosidase (BGL; Blon_0625) derived from 
      Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697. The Blon_0625 gene was expressed 
      by recombinant Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant Blon_0625 retains hydrolyzing 
      activity against both p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG; 17.3±0.24Umg(-1)) and 
      p-nitrophenyl-β-D-xylopyranoside (pNPX; 16.7±0.32Umg(-1)) at pH 6.0, 30°C. To best 
      of our knowledge, no previously described BGL retains the same level of both pNPGase 
      and pNPXase activity. Furthermore, Blon_0625 also retains the activity against 
      4-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofranoside (pNPAf; 5.6±0.09Umg(-1)). In addition, the 
      results of the degradation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) or xylan 
      using endoglucanase from Thermobifida fusca YX (Tfu_0901) or xylanase from 
      Kitasatospora setae KM-6054 (KSE_59480) show that Blon_0625 acts as a BGL and as a 
      β-D-xylosidase (XYL) for hydrolyzing oligosaccharides. These results clearly 
      indicate that Blon_0625 is a multi-functional glycoside hydrolase which retains the 
      activity of BGL, XYL, and also α-l-arabinofuranosidase. Therefore, the utilization 
      of multi-functional Blon_0625 may contribute to facilitating the efficient 
      degradation of lignocellulosic materials and help enhance bioconversion processes.

TI  - Degradation of nitrocellulose-based paint by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 13541.
PG  - 705-16
LID - 10.1007/s10532-012-9546-9 [doi]
AB  - Nitrocellulose is one of the most commonly used compounds in ammunition and paint 
      industries and its recalcitrance to degradation has a negative impact on human 
      health and the environment. In this study the capability of Desulfovibrio 
      desulfuricans ATCC 13541 to degrade nitrocellulose as binder in paint was assayed 
      for the first time. Nitrocellulose-based paint degradation was followed by 
      monitoring the variation in nitrate, nitrite and ammonium content in the culture 
      medium using Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy. At the same time cell counts and ATP 
      assay were performed to estimate bacterial density and activity in all samples. 
      Infrared spectroscopy and colorimetric measurements of paint samples were performed 
      to assess chemical and colour changes due to the microbial action. Microscope 
      observations of nitrocellulose-based paint samples demonstrated the capability of 
      the bacterium to adhere to the paint surface and change the paint adhesive 
      characteristics. Finally, preliminary studies of nitrocellulose degradation pathway 
      were conducted by assaying nitrate- and nitrite reductases activity in 
      D. desulfuricans grown in presence or in absence of paint. We found that 
      D. desulfuricans ATCC 13541 is able to transform nitrocellulose as paint binder and 
      we hypothesised ammonification as degradation pathway. The results suggest that 
      D. desulfuricans ATCC 13541 is a good candidate as a nitrocellulose-degrading 
      bacterium.

TI  - Biodetoxification of Phenolic Inhibitors from Lignocellulose Pretreatment using 
      Kurthia huakuii LAM0618(T) and Subsequent Lactic Acid Fermentation.
LID - 10.3390/molecules23102626 [doi]
LID - 2626
AB  - Phenolic inhibitors generated during alkaline pretreatment of lignocellulosic 
      biomasses significantly hinder bacterial growth and subsequent biofuel and 
      biochemical production. Water rinsing is an efficient method for removing these 
      compounds. Nevertheless, this method often generates a great amount of wastewater, 
      and leads to the loss of solid fiber particles and fermentable sugars. Kurthia 
      huakuii LAM0618(T), a recently identified microorganism, was herein shown to be able 
      to efficiently transform phenolic compounds (syringaldehyde, hydroxybenzaldehyde, 
      and vanillin) into less toxic acids. Taking advantage of these properties, a 
      biodetoxification method was established by inoculating K. huakuii LAM0618(T) into 
      the NH₃/H₂O₂-pretreated unwashed corn stover to degrade phenolic inhibitors and weak 
      acids generated during the pretreatment. Subsequently, 33.47 and 17.91 g/L lactic 
      acid was produced by Bacillus coagulans LA204 at 50 °C through simultaneous 
      saccharification and fermentation (SSF) from 8% (w/w) of NH₃/H₂O₂-pretreated corn 
      stover with or without K. huakuii LAM0618(T)-biodetoxification, indicating 
      biodetoxification significantly increased lactic acid titer and yield. Importantly, 
      using 15% (w/w) of the NH₃/H₂O₂-pretreated K. huakuii LAM0618(T)-biodetoxified corn 
      stover as a substrate through fed-batch simultaneous saccharification and 
      fermentation, high titer and high yield of lactic acid (84.49 g/L and 0.56 g/g corn 
      stover, respectively, with a productivity of 0.88 g/L/h) were produced by Bacillus 
      coagulans LA204. Therefore, this study reported the first study on biodetoxification 
      of alkaline-pretreated lignocellulosic material, and this biodetoxification method 
      could replace water rinsing for removal of phenolic inhibitors and applied in 
      biofuel and biochemical production using the alkaline-pretreated lignocellulosic 
      bioresources.

TI  - Forest harvesting reduces the soil metagenomic potential for biomass decomposition.
PG  - 2465-76
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2015.57 [doi]
AB  - Soil is the key resource that must be managed to ensure sustainable forest 
      productivity. Soil microbial communities mediate numerous essential ecosystem 
      functions, and recent studies show that forest harvesting alters soil community 
      composition. From a long-term soil productivity study site in a temperate coniferous 
      forest in British Columbia, 21 forest soil shotgun metagenomes were generated, 
      totaling 187 Gb. A method to analyze unassembled metagenome reads from the complex 
      community was optimized and validated. The subsequent metagenome analysis revealed 
      that, 12 years after forest harvesting, there were 16% and 8% reductions in relative 
      abundances of biomass decomposition genes in the organic and mineral soil layers, 
      respectively. Organic and mineral soil layers differed markedly in genetic potential 
      for biomass degradation, with the organic layer having greater potential and being 
      more strongly affected by harvesting. Gene families were disproportionately 
      affected, and we identified 41 gene families consistently affected by harvesting, 
      including families involved in lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin 
      degradation. The results strongly suggest that harvesting profoundly altered 
      below-ground cycling of carbon and other nutrients at this site, with potentially 
      important consequences for forest regeneration. Thus, it is important to determine 
      whether these changes foreshadow long-term changes in forest productivity or 
      resilience and whether these changes are broadly characteristic of harvested 
      forests.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of bacterial-mediated polyethylene (PE) 
      degradation in a two-phase microcosm experiment. During phase I, naturally weathered 
      PE films were incubated for 6 months with the indigenous marine community alone as 
      well as bioaugmented with strains able to grow in minimal medium with linear 
      low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) as the sole carbon source. At the end of phase I 
      the developed biofilm was harvested and re-inoculated with naturally weathered PE 
      films. Bacteria from both treatments were able to establish an active population on 
      the PE surfaces as the biofilm community developed in a time dependent way. 
      Moreover, a convergence in the composition of these communities was observed towards 
      an efficient PE degrading microbial network, comprising of indigenous species. In 
      acclimated communities, genera affiliated with synthetic (PE) and natural 
      (cellulose) polymer degraders as well as hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were 
      enriched. The acclimated consortia (indigenous and bioaugmented) reduced more 
      efficiently the weight of PE films in comparison to non-acclimated bacteria. The SEM 
      images revealed a dense and compact biofilm layer and signs of bio-erosion on the 
      surface of the films. Rheological results suggest that the polymers after microbial 
      treatment had wider molecular mass distribution and a marginally smaller average 
      molar mass suggesting biodegradation as opposed to abiotic degradation. 
      Modifications on the surface chemistry were observed throughout phase II while the 
      FTIR profiles of microbially treated films at month 6 were similar to the profiles 
      of virgin PE. Taking into account the results, we can suggest that the tailored 
      indigenous marine community represents an efficient consortium for degrading 
      weathered PE plastics.

AB  - High recalcitrant characteristics and low bioavailability rates due to aging 
      processes can hinder high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
      (HMW-PAHs) bioremediation in real industrial polluted soils. With the aim of 
      reducing the residual fraction of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and (HMW-PAHs) 
      in creosote-contaminated soil remaining after a 180-d treatment in a pilot-scale 
      biopile, either biostimulation (BS) of indigenous microbial populations with a 
      lignocellulosic substrate (LS) or fungal bioaugmentation with two strains of 
      white-rot fungi (WRF) (i.e., Trametes versicolor and Lentinus tigrinus) were 
      comparatively tested. The impact of bivalent manganese ions and two mobilizing 
      agents (MAs) (i.e., Soybean Oil and Brij 30) on the degradation performances of 
      biostimulated and bioaugmented microcosms was also compared. The results reveal soil 
      colonization by both WRF strains was clearly hampered by an active native soil 
      microbiota. In fact, a proper enhancement of native microbiota by means of LS 
      amendment promoted the highest biodegradation of HMW-PAHs, even of those with five 
      aromatic rings after 60 days of treatment, but HMW-PAH-degrading bacteria were 
      specifically inhibited when non-ionic surfactant Brij 30 was amended. Effects of 
      bioaugmentation and other additives such as non-ionic surfactants on the degrading 
      capability of autochthonous soil microbiota should be evaluated in polluted soils 
      before scaling up the remediation process at field scale.

AB  - The present study investigates the kraft lignin (KL) degrading potential of novel 
      alkalotolerant Pandoraea sp. ISTKB utilizing KL as sole carbon source. The results 
      displayed 50.2 % reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 41.1 % decolorization 
      after bacterial treatment. The maximum lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese 
      peroxidase (MnP) activity detected was 2.73 and 4.33 U ml(-1), respectively, on day 
      3. The maximum extracellular and intracellular laccase activities observed were 1.32 
      U ml(-1) on day 5 and 4.53 U ml(-1) on day 4, respectively. The decolorization and 
      degradation was maximum on day 2. Further, it registered an increase with the 
      production of extracellular laccase. This unusual trend of decolorization and 
      degradation was studied using various aromatic compounds and dyes. SEM and FTIR 
      results indicated significant change in surface morphology and functional group 
      composition during the course of degradation. Gas chromatography and mass 
      spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis confirmed KL degradation by emergence of new peaks and 
      the identification of low molecular weight aromatic intermediates in treated sample. 
      The degradation of KL progressed through the generation of phenolic intermediates. 
      The identified intermediates implied the degradation of hydroxyphenyl, ferulic acid, 
      guaiacyl, syringyl, phenylcoumarane, and pinoresinol components commonly found in 
      lignin. The degradation, decolorization, and GC-MS analysis indicated potential 
      application of the isolate Pandoraea sp. ISTKB in treatment of lignin-containing 
      pollutants and KL valorization.

AB  - Co-composting of poultry manure and rubber wood sawdust was performed with the ratio 
      of 2:1 (V/V) for a period of 60 days. An investigation was carried out to study the 
      extracellular enzymatic activities and structural degradation utilizing Fourier 
      transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetry and differential thermal 
      analysis (TG/DTA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The microbial succession 
      was also determined by using denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE). The 
      compost was able to reach its highest temperature of 71°C at day 3 and stabilized 
      between 30 and 40°C for 8 weeks. CMCase, FPase and β-glucosidase acted 
      synergistically in order to degrade the cellulosic substrate. The xylanase 
      activities increased gradually during the composting and reached the peak value of 
      11.637 U/g on day 35, followed by a sharp decline. Both LiP and MnP activities 
      reached their peak values on day 35 with 0.431 and 0.132 U/g respectively. The FT-IR 
      spectra revealed an increase in aromaticity and a decrease in aliphatic compounds 
      such as carbohydrates as decomposition proceeded. TGA/DTG data exhibited significant 
      changes in weight loss in compost samples, indicating degradation of organic matter. 
      SEM micrographs showed higher amounts of parenchyma exposed on the surface of rubber 
      wood sawdust at day 60, showing significant degradation. DGGE and 16S rDNA analyses 
      showed that Burkholderia sp., Pandoraea sp., and Pseudomonas sp. were present 
      throughout the composting process. Ornithinibacillus sp. and Castellaniella 
      ginsengisoli were only found in the initial stage of the composting, while different 
      strains of Burkholderia sp. also occurred in the later stage of composting.

AB  - A sequential chem-bio hybrid process was developed using a novel biochar supported 
      carboxymethyl cellulose-stabilized nanoscale iron sulfide (CMC-FeS@biochar) as a 
      chemical remover and Corynebacterium variabile HRJ4 as a biological agent for 
      trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation. Compared with CMC-FeS, FeS@biochar600, bare FeS 
      and biochar600, the CMC-FeS@biochar600 composite displayed better physiochemical 
      properties (smaller hydrodynamic diameter and higher stability) and demonstrated 
      excellent removal capacity for TCE from aqueous phase. A facultative bacterial 
      strain, Corynebacterium variabile HRJ4, growing well in the presence of 
      CMC-FeS@biochar (added up to 0.25 g L(-1)), further enhanced TCE removal after 
      chemical treatment. The dechlorination pathway proposed based on the gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that TCE was 
      dechlorinated to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and acetylene via hydrogenolysis 
      and β-elimination, respectively within 12 h by CMC-FeS@biochar. Addition of HRJ4 
      strain into the reaction system effectively enhanced the degradation of the residual 
      TCE, cis-DCE and acetylene to ethylene. Acetylene was the main product in chemical 
      process, whereas ethylene was the main product in biological process as strain HRJ4 
      could reduce acetylene to ethylene effectively. The results of this study signify 
      the potential application of CMC-FeS@biochar600/HRJ4 chem-bio hybrid system for 
      complete degradation of TCE in the anaerobic environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Renewable biopolymers, such as cellulose, starch and chitin are highly 
      resistance to enzymatic degradation. Therefore, there is a need to upgrade current 
      degradation processes by including novel enzymes. Lytic polysaccharide 
      mono-oxygenases (LPMOs) can disrupt recalcitrant biopolymers, thereby enhancing 
      hydrolysis by conventional enzymes. However, novel LPMO families are difficult to 
      identify using existing methods. Therefore, we developed a novel profile Hidden 
      Markov model (HMM) and used it to mine genomes of ascomycetous fungi for novel 
      LPMOs. RESULTS: We constructed a structural alignment and verified that the 
      alignment was correct. In the alignment we identified several known conserved 
      features, such as the histidine brace and the N/Q/E-X-F/Y motif and previously 
      unidentified conserved proline and glycine residues. These residues are distal from 
      the active site, suggesting a role in structure rather than activity. The multiple 
      protein alignment was subsequently used to build a profile Hidden Markov model. This 
      model was initially tested on manually curated datasets and proved to be both 
      sensitive (no false negatives) and specific (no false positives). In some of the 
      genomes analyzed we identified a yet unknown LPMO family. This new family is mostly 
      confined to the phyla of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota and the class of Oomycota. 
      Genomic clustering indicated that at least some members might be involved in the 
      degradation of β-glucans, while transcriptomic data suggested that others are 
      possibly involved in the degradation of pectin. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed 
      profile hidden Markov Model was successfully used to mine fungal genomes for a novel 
      family of LPMOs. However, the model is not limited to bacterial and fungal genomes. 
      This is illustrated by the fact that the model was also able to identify another new 
      LPMO family in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, the Hidden Markov model was 
      used to verify the more distant blast hits from the new fungal family of LPMOs, 
      which belong to the Bivalves, Stony corals and Sea anemones. So this Hidden Markov 
      model (Additional file 3) will help the broader scientific community in identifying 
      other yet unknown LPMOs.

AB  - One design concept for the long-term management of the UK's intermediate level 
      radioactive wastes (ILW) is disposal to a cementitious geological disposal facility 
      (GDF). Under the alkaline (10.0<pH>13.0) anoxic conditions expected within a GDF, 
      cellulosic wastes will undergo chemical hydrolysis. The resulting cellulose 
      degradation products (CDP) are dominated by α- and β-isosaccharinic acids (ISA), 
      which present an organic carbon source that may enable subsequent microbial 
      colonisation of a GDF. Microcosms established from neutral, near-surface sediments 
      demonstrated complete ISA degradation under methanogenic conditions up to pH 10.0. 
      Degradation decreased as pH increased, with β-ISA fermentation more heavily 
      influenced than α-ISA. This reduction in degradation rate was accompanied by a shift 
      in microbial population away from organisms related to Clostridium sporosphaeroides 
      to a more diverse Clostridial community. The increase in pH to 10.0 saw an increase 
      in detection of Alcaligenes aquatilis and a dominance of hydrogenotrophic 
      methanogens within the Archaeal population. Methane was generated up to pH 10.0 with 
      acetate accumulation at higher pH values reflecting a reduced detection of 
      acetoclastic methanogens. An increase in pH to 11.0 resulted in the accumulation of 
      ISA, the absence of methanogenesis and the loss of biomass from the system. This 
      study is the first to demonstrate methanogenesis from ISA by near surface microbial 
      communities not previously exposed to these compounds up to and including pH 10.0.

AB  - Enriched microorganisms in sediment collected from a dioxin-contaminated site in 
      Vietnam (Bien Hoa airbase) were used for examining the effectiveness in biological 
      treatment of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in soil. Four bio-treatments were 
      investigated using a sequential anaerobic (17 weeks) followed by an aerobic (6 
      weeks) incubation. The maximum removal efficiency was approximately 60% even at an 
      extremely low pH (approx. 3.6) condition. Surfactant Tween-80 was added to enhance 
      the bioavailability of dioxin in two treatments, but it appeared to biostimulate 
      methanogens rather than dechlorinators. As a result, methane production was the 
      highest while the dioxin removal efficiency was the lowest, as compared with the 
      other bio-treatments. Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) coated on nanoscale zero valent 
      iron (nZVI) surface used in two treatments could prevent the direct contact between 
      bacterial cell surface and nZVI which prevented cell death and lysis, hence 
      enhancing dioxin removal. The presence of CMC--_nZVI in bio-treatments gradually 
      released H2 required for microbiological processes, but the amount used in the 
      experiments were likely too high to maintain optimum H2 levels for biostimulating 
      dechlorinators rather than methanogens.

TI  - Degradation of lignocelluloses in rice straw by BMC-9, a composite microbial system.
PG  - 585-724
AB  - To evaluate the potential utility of pretreatment of raw biomass with a complex 
      microbial system, we investigated the degradation of rice straw by BMC-9, a 
      lignocellulose decomposition strain obtained from a biogas slurry compost 
      environment. The degradation characteristics and corresponding changes in the 
      bacterial community were assessed. The results showed that rapid degradation 
      occurred from day 0 to day 9, with a peak total biomass bacterium concentration of 
      3.3 × 10(8) copies/ml on day 1. The pH of the fermentation broth declined initially 
      and then increased, and the mass of rice straw decreased steadily. The highest 
      concentrations of volatile fatty acid contents (0.291 mg/l lactic acid, 0.31 mg/l 
      formic acid, 1.93 mg/l acetic acid, and 0.73 mg/l propionic acid) as well as the 
      highest xylanse activity (1.79 U/ml) and carboxymethyl cellulase activity (0.37 
      U/ml) occurred on day 9. The greatest diversity among the microbial community also 
      occurred on day 9, with the presence of bacteria belonging to Clostridium sp., 
      Bacillus sp., and Geobacillus sp. Together, our results indicate that BMC-9 has a 
      strong ability to rapidly degrade the lignocelluloses of rice straw under relatively 
      inexpensive conditions, and the optimum fermentation time is 9 days.

AB  - The main aim of this research was to study the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic 
      hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the influence of environmental factors during composting in 
      order to realize the utilization of PAHs contaminated sewage sludge. A production 
      scale compost experiment was conducted with three mixtures of sewage sludge (SS): 
      green forest waste (GFW) at quality ratios of 3:1 (T1), 3:2 (T2) and 3:3 (T3). The 
      residual concentration of PAHs in the three treatments met the permissible limit 
      prescribed by the Agricultural Sludge Pollutant Control Standard (GB 4284-2018). The 
      biodegradation rates of PAHs were 0.0280, 0.0281 and 0.0218 mg/d, and removal 
      efficiencies were 70.7%, 75.2% and 62.4% in T1, T2, T3, respectively, which followed 
      the first-order rate kinetics. The residual concentration of PAHs in T2 was the 
      lowest (1.81 mg/kg), while the germination index (GI) of Tall Fescues (~0.9) was the 
      highest during 50 days of co-composting. The bacterial diversity negatively 
      correlated with the residual PAHs content. The main genus, Bacillus, Pseudomonas and 
      Methylotenera, with cellulose-degrading and PAHs co-metabolizing functions 
      contributed significantly to sludge maturation and PAHs degradation. The dominant 
      microorganisms, Pseudomonas, Sphingobacterium and Chitinophagaceae_uncultured, could 
      support the high removal rate of PAHs in T2. Temperature, pH, total organic carbon 
      (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio had significant positive 
      effect on the compost maturity and quality, and these parameters correlated with the 
      PAHs biodegradation efficiency during composting, especially in T2.

TI  - Tight modulation of Escherichia coli bacterial biofilm formation through controlled 
      expression of adhesion factors.
PG  - 3391-403
AB  - Despite the economic and sanitary problems caused by harmful biofilms, biofilms are 
      nonetheless used empirically in industrial environmental and bioremediation 
      processes and may be of potential use in medical settings for interfering with 
      pathogen development. Escherichia coli is one of the bacteria with which biofilm 
      formation has been studied in great detail, and it is especially appreciated for 
      biotechnology applications because of its genetic amenability. Here we describe the 
      development of two new genetic tools enabling the constitutive and inducible 
      expression of any gene or operon of interest at its native locus. In addition to 
      providing valuable tools for complementation and overexpression experiments, these 
      two compact genetic cassettes were used to modulate the biofilm formation capacities 
      of E. coli by taking control of two biofilm-promoting factors, autotransported 
      antigen 43 adhesin and the bscABZC cellulose operon. The modulation of the biofilm 
      formation capacities of E. coli or those of other bacteria capable of being 
      genetically manipulated may be of use both for reducing and for improving the impact 
      of biofilms in a number of industrial and medical applications.

AB  - As a prerequisite additive, bulking agent played an essential role on organic wastes 
      biodrying by affecting the organics degradation and microbial consortia. In this 
      study, a series of experiments were conducted to explore the relationships among the 
      type of bulking agents, organics degradation and microbial community evolution. In 
      line with the excellent physiochemical properties, corncob was found to be more 
      desirable for biodrying with more water removal (62.13% vs. 53.70% for sawdust and 
      51.72% for straw) and higher energy efficiency. Furthermore, different bulking 
      agents showed different biodegradability and affected co-existed organics 
      degradation. In detail, corncob upgraded the amylase and lipase activities, thus 
      promoting the degradation of readily degradable carbohydrates and lipids in 
      feedstocks, which accounted for >60% of the bio-heat sources for water evaporation. 
      In addition, pyrosequencing analysis revealed that Bacillus (>50%) and Ochrobactrum 
      (>40%) were the dominant genera in thermophilic and cooling phases, with degradation 
      capacities of readily degradable substrate and lignocellulose, respectively. And the 
      pathogens, e.g., E. coli and K. pneumonia, were seriously inhibited by high matrix 
      temperatures in corncob trial. These results not only suggested the corncob was a 
      promising bulking agent, but the potential microbial mechanisms for organics 
      degradation were also revealed.

AB  - Performance stability is a key issue when managing anaerobic digesters. However it 
      can be affected by external disturbances caused by micropollutants. In this study 
      the influence of phenol on the methanization of cellulose was evaluated through 
      batch toxicity assays. Special attention was given to the dynamics of microbial 
      communities by means of automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. We observed 
      that, as phenol concentrations increased, the different steps of anaerobic cellulose 
      digestion were unevenly and progressively affected, methanogenesis being the most 
      sensitive: specific methanogenic activity was half-inhibited at 1.40 g/L of phenol, 
      whereas hydrolysis of cellulose and its fermentation to VFA were observed at up to 
      2.00 g/L. Depending on the level of phenol, microbial communities resisted either 
      through physiological or structural adaptation. Thus, performances at 0.50 g/L were 
      maintained in spite of the microbial community's shift. However, the communities' 
      ability to adapt was limited and performances decreased drastically beyond 2.00 g/L 
      of phenol.

AB  - A microbial consortium, designated WCS-6, was established by successive 
      subcultivation in the presence of rice straw under static conditions. The 
      degradation efficiencies of WSC-6 for 0.5 g filter paper, cotton and rice straw 
      after 3 days of cultivation were 99.0±0.7%, 76.9±1.5% and 81.3±0.8%, respectively as 
      determined by gravimetrical methods. Nine bacterial isolates were obtained from 
      WCS-6 plated under aerobic conditions, and sequencing of their 16S rDNA indicated 
      that these bacteria were related to Bacillus thermoamylovorans BTa, Paenibacillus 
      barengoltzii SAFN-016, Proteobacterium S072, Pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis CB-226, 
      Rhizobiaceae str. M100, Bacillus sp. E53-10, Beta proteobacterium HMD444, 
      Petrobacter succinimandens 4BON, and Tepidiphilus margaritifer N2-214. DGGE 
      (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and sequencing of 16S rDNA sequences 
      amplified from total consortium DNA revealed the presence of sequences related to 
      those of Ureibacillus thermosphaericus, uncultured bacterium clone GC3, uncultured 
      Clostridium sp. clone A1-3, Clostridium thermobutyricum, and Clostridium 
      thermosuccinogenes in addition to the sequences identified from the cultured 
      bacteria. The microbial community identified herein is a potential candidate 
      consortium for the degradation of waste lignocellulosic biomass.

AB  - In this work, a bacterial surface displaying enzyme based two-compartment biofuel 
      cell for the direct electrical energy conversion from degradation products of 
      lignocellulosic biomass is reported. Considering that the main degradation products 
      of the lignocellulose are glucose and xylose, xylose dehydrogenase (XDH) displayed 
      bacteria (XDH-bacteria) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) displayed bacteria 
      (GDH-bacteria) were used as anode catalysts in anode chamber with methylene blue as 
      electron transfer mediator. While the cathode chamber was constructed with 
      laccase/multi-walled-carbon nanotube/glassy-carbon-electrode. XDH-bacteria exhibited 
      1.75 times higher catalytic efficiency than GDH-bacteria. This assembled enzymatic 
      fuel cell exhibited a high open-circuit potential of 0.80 V, acceptable stability 
      and energy conversion efficiency. Moreover, the maximum power density of the cell 
      could reach 53 μW cm(-2) when fueled with degradation products of corn stalk. Thus, 
      this finding holds great potential to directly convert degradation products of 
      biomass into electrical energy.

TI  - Chlorate reduction capacity and characterisation of chlorate reducing bacteria 
      communities in sediments of the rio Cruces wetland in southern Chile.
PG  - 3283-92

AB  - This study investigated chlorate reduction kinetics in multiple samples of sediments 
      from a longitudinal profile of a wetland located downstream of the effluent 
      discharge of a cellulose plant, including characterisation of the bacterial 
      communities involved. The sediments were exposed to different initial chlorate 
      concentrations in microcosm tests, with and without the addition of acetate as an 
      external electron donor, and in a matrix of natural water or a defined medium. At a 
      high initial chlorate concentration of 100 mg/L, in the absence of an external 
      electron source, the degradation curves presented first-order kinetics, influenced 
      by electron donor availability. The first-order kinetic constant varied between 0.05 
      and 0.17 day(-1). Subsequently, when the initial chlorate concentration was reduced 
      to 7 mg/L, a zero-order kinetic was obtained, with the kinetic constant presenting 
      values between 1.1 and 1.3 mg/L-day. No correlation was observed between chlorate 
      degradation kinetics and the location of the sampling points or the previous history 
      of exposure to chlorate. Other factors evaluated, such as the availability of 
      organic matter or the chlorate reducing bacteria count, also proved not to have any 
      incidence on the results. The richness of chlorate reducing bacteria species in the 
      different samples analysed were also similar, with the greatest similarity being 
      found between cld genes in the samples from the upstream or downstream sampling 
      points. Additionally, cld genes most similar to those present in PCRB like 
      Dechlorospirillum sp., Alicycliphilus denitrificans, Dechloromonas agitata, 
      Dechloromonas sp. LT1 and Ideonella dechloratans were detected. This study showed 
      that the anaerobic sediments of the Cruces river wetland present a high potential 
      for chlorate natural attenuation, regardless of the previous history of exposure to 
      chlorate. This capacity is associated with the presence of a diverse community of 
      chlorate reducing bacteria.

TI  - Production of Xanthanases by Paenibacillus spp.: Complete Xanthan Degradation and 
      Possible Applications.
PG  - 120-127
LID - 10.15171/ijb.1477 [doi]
AB  - Background: A number of microorganisms and their enzymes have been reported as 
      xanthan depolymerizers. Paenibacillus species are well-known polysaccharide 
      hydrolyzing bacteria. However, Paenibacillus alginolyticus and Paenibacillus sp. XD 
      are the only species in the genus which are now known to degrade xanthan. 
      Objectives: Complete biodegradation of the xanthan exopolysaccharide is a rarely 
      found capability among microorganisms. The aim of this study is to survey xanthanase 
      producing bacteria with an appropriate bioactivity for the biopolymer degradation 
      under different environmental conditions. Materials and Methods: The bacteria were 
      isolated based on viscosity reduction of the xanthan solution. Bacterial isolates 
      were identified using rep-PCR (repetitive element-based genomic fingerprinting) and 
      16S rDNA sequencing. Xanthanases were identified using rep-PCR (repetitive 
      element-based genomic fingerprinting) and 16S rDNA sequencing. Xanthanases were 
      characterized by measuring their activity at different temperatures, pH values, and 
      NaCl concentrations. Degradation of other polysaccharides and xanthan degradation 
      products were investigated based on the screening plate method and TLC (thin-layer 
      chromatography), respectively. Results:Six isolates from different Paenibacillus 
      species with a complete xanthan degrading capability were isolated from Urmia Lake. 
      Phylogenetic analysis placed these strains within the genus Paenibacillus with the 
      closest relatives that were found to be P. nanensis, P. phyllosphaerae, P. 
      agaridevorans, P. agarexedens, and P. taohuashanense. These isolates displayed 
      different levels of the xanthan biodegradation activity in temperatures ranging from 
      15 to 55°C and pH values from 4 to 11. Xanthanolytic activity was generally 
      prevented in presence of NaCl (> 0.1 mol.L-1). Furthermore, the isolated 
      Paenibacillus spp. could degrade several other polysaccharides including xylan, CMC 
      (carboxymethyl cellulose), starch, alginate, and pectin. Conclusion: Novel strains 
      of the six different Paenibacillus species that were introduced in the present study 
      are able to produce xanthanases with interesting characteristics. In light of the 
      results from this study, special applications, particularly in healthcare, medicine, 
      and the environment is hereby proposed for these enzymes.

TI  - Genome Sequence of Microbulbifer mangrovi DD-13(T) Reveals Its Versatility to 
      Degrade Multiple Polysaccharides.
PG  - 116-124
LID - 10.1007/s10126-017-9737-9 [doi]
AB  - Microbulbifer mangrovi strain DD-13(T) is a novel-type species isolated from the 
      mangroves of Goa, India. The draft genome sequence of strain DD-13 comprised 
      4,528,106 bp with G+C content of 57.15%. Out of 3479 open reading frames, functions 
      for 3488 protein coding sequences were predicted on the basis of similarity with the 
      cluster of orthologous groups. In addition to protein coding sequences, 34 tRNA 
      genes and 3 rRNA genes were detected. Analysis of nucleotide sequence of predicted 
      gene using a Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZymes) Analysis Toolkit indicates that 
      strain DD-13 encodes a large set of CAZymes including 255 glycoside hydrolases, 76 
      carbohydrate esterases, 17 polysaccharide lyases, and 113 carbohydrate-binding 
      modules (CBMs). Many genes from strain DD-13 were annotated as carbohydrases 
      specific for degradation of agar, alginate, carrageenan, chitin, xylan, pullulan, 
      cellulose, starch, β-glucan, pectin, etc. Some of polysaccharide-degrading genes 
      were highly modular and were appended at least with one CBM indicating the 
      versatility of strain DD-13 to degrade complex polysaccharides. The cell growth of 
      strain DD-13 was validated using pure polysaccharides such as agarose or alginate as 
      carbon source as well as by using red and brown seaweed powder as substrate. The 
      homologous carbohydrase produced by strain DD-13 during growth degraded the 
      polysaccharide, ensuring the production of metabolizable reducing sugars. 
      Additionally, several other polysaccharides such as carrageenan, xylan, pullulan, 
      pectin, starch, and carboxymethyl cellulose were also corroborated as growth 
      substrate for strain DD-13 and were associated with concomitant production of 
      homologous carbohydrase.

AB  - Scarce information is available on the changes in abundance of microbial taxa during 
      vermicomposting. Quantitative PCR and DGGE analysis were used to monitor variations 
      in the microbial structure, relative abundance of four bacterial classes and fungi 
      over the vermicomposting and maturation period of wet olive cake (O) and vine shoots 
      (W). Multivariate correlation analysis between microbial structure and abundance, 
      earthworm biomass and enzyme activities revealed similar and divergent interactions 
      in both processes. Although Eisenia fetida development was different, significant 
      correlations were found with β-glucosidase activity and with bacterial and fungal 
      structure. In the vermicomposting period of O and W, a decline was found in bacteria 
      (94% and 77%), fungi (93% and 94%), and Gammaproteobacteria (56% and 71%) but an 
      increase in Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria (62-79%). Alphaproteobacteria 
      increased only in O (26%). Despite the different initial lignocellulose wastes, the 
      mature vermicomposts were similar in microbial and biochemical properties.

AB  - Anaerobic degradation of lignin-derived aromatics is an important metabolism for 
      carbon and nutrient cycles in soil environments. Although there are some studies on 
      degradation of lignin-derived aromatics by nitrate- and sulfate-reducing bacteria, 
      knowledge on their degradation under methanogenic conditions are quite limited. In 
      this study, methanogenic microbial communities were enriched from rice paddy field 
      soil with lignin-derived methoxylated monoaromatics (vanillate and syringate) and 
      their degradation intermediates (protocatechuate, catechol, and gallate) as the sole 
      carbon and energy sources. Archaeal community analysis disclosed that both 
      aceticlastic (Methanosarcina sp.) and hydrogenotrophic (Methanoculleus sp. and 
      Methanocella sp.) methanogens dominated in all of the enrichments. Bacterial 
      community analysis revealed the dominance of acetogenic bacteria (Sporomusa spp.) 
      only in the enrichments on the methoxylated aromatics, suggesting that Sporomusa 
      spp. initially convert vanillate and syringate into protocatechuate and gallate, 
      respectively, with acetogenesis via O-demethylation. As the putative ring-cleavage 
      microbes, bacteria within the phylum Firmicutes were dominantly detected from all of 
      the enrichments, while the dominant phylotypes were not identical between 
      enrichments on vanillate/protocatechuate/catechol (family Peptococcaceae bacteria) 
      and on syringate/gallate (family Ruminococcaceae bacteria). This study demonstrates 
      the importance of cooperation among acetogens, ring-cleaving fermenters/syntrophs 
      and aceticlastic/hydrogenotrophic methanogens for degradation of lignin-derived 
      aromatics under methanogenic conditions.

AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR analyses of Escherichia coli str. BL21(DE3) exposed to 
      0.5 g/L ferulic and coumaric acid showed that the inaA gene was significantly 
      induced (7.7- and 3.6-fold higher, respectively). Consequently, a transcriptional 
      fusion of the inaA promoter with the luxCDABE operon was constructed and 
      characterized with several compounds identified within hydrolysates. Tests 
      demonstrated that the phenolics were major inducers, while acetic acid and furfural 
      had only a minor or no effect on the inaA expression respectively. Additional tests 
      with mutant E. coli strains found that a marA partially abolished the response while 
      a marB knock-out led to a 2-3-fold higher basal level expression as evidenced by the 
      bioluminescent levels of the cultures. However, a significant induction was seen 
      even in the marA mutant, suggesting some other control mechanism is involved in 
      regulating inaA expression during an exposure to the hydrolysate compounds. Finally, 
      E. coli str. BL21(DE3)/pSP4 was used to analyze a spruce hydrolysate sample. 
      Real-time quantitative PCR showed a 2.8-fold induction of the inaA expression level 
      while the bioluminescence from the exposed culture was 22-fold higher than the 
      control, demonstrating the possible application of this reporter strain to analyze 
      hydrolysates for the presence of fermentation-inhibiting phenolics.

TI  - Substantially enhanced degradation of hexachlorocyclohexane isomers by a microbial 
      consortium on acclimation.
PG  - 1046-54
LID - 10.1021/jf9038259 [doi]
AB  - Widespread contamination of the environment, globally, has been caused by extensive 
      and indiscriminate use of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) as an insecticide since the 
      1940s, threatening the biota including humans, and there is an urgent need to 
      eliminate it, preferably through bioremediation technologies. A gamma-HCH-degrading 
      microbial consortium was isolated by enrichment of a soil sample from a sugar cane 
      field having a long history of technical grade HCH application. On acclimation the 
      degrading ability improved substantially. The consortium, which took 10 days to 
      degrade 25 microg mL(-1) of gamma-HCH, initially could mineralize even 300 microg 
      mL(-1) of the substrate within 108 h on acclimation. With 300 microg mL(-1) 
      substrate, the rate of degradation, as calculated for the early exponential phase, 
      was 216 microg mL(-1) day(-1), the highest reported so far. An amount of 400 microg 
      mL(-1) of gamma-HCH, however, was mineralized partially with only 78% Cl(-) release. 
      No apparent accumulation of intermediary metabolites was observed up to 300 microg 
      mL(-1) substrate, indicating a fast rate of mineralization. Aeration, mesophilic 
      temperatures (20-35 degrees C), and near neutral pH (6.0-8.0) were favorable 
      conditions for degradation. The presence of glucose at 1000 microg mL(-1) retarded 
      the degradation, whereas cellulose and sawdust at 1600 microg mL(-1) and glucose at 
      100 microg mL(-1) did not show any marked effect. The consortium also mineralized 
      alpha-, beta-, and delta-HCH efficiently. The consortium consisted of nine bacterial 
      strains and a fungal strain, and individually they were able to degrade 10 microg 
      mL(-1) of gamma-HCH. This mixed culture holds high potential for deployment in 
      bioremediation of HCH-contaminated soils, waste dumpsites, and water bodies.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of the bacterial community in a full scale autothermal

      land spread.
PG  - 2488-504
LID - 10.1016/j.watres.2012.01.045 [doi]
AB  - The bacterial community associated with a full scale autothermal thermophilic 
      aerobic digester (ATAD) treating sludge, originating from domestic wastewater and 
      destined for land spread, was analysed using a number of molecular approaches 
      optimised specifically for this high temperature environment. 16S rDNA genes were 
      amplified directly from sludge with universally conserved and Bacteria-specific rDNA 
      gene primers and a clone library constructed that corresponded to the late 
      thermophilic stage (t = 23 h) of the ATAD process. Sequence analyses revealed 
      various 16S rDNA gene sequence types reflective of high bacterial community 
      diversity. Members of the bacterial community included α- and β-Proteobacteria, 
      Actinobacteria with High G + C content and Gram-Positive bacteria with a prevalence 
      of the Firmicutes (Low G + C) division (class Clostridia and Bacillus). Most of the 
      ATAD clones showed affiliation with bacterial species previously isolated or 
      detected in other elevated temperature environments, at alkaline pH, or in cellulose 
      rich environments. Several phylotypes associated with Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing 
      anaerobes were also detected. The presence of anaerobes was of interest in such 
      large scale systems where sub-optimal aeration and mixing is often the norm while 
      the presence of large amounts of capnophiles suggest the possibility of limited 
      convection and entrapment of CO(2) within the sludge matrix during digestion. 
      Comparative analysis with organism identified in other ATAD systems revealed 
      significant differences based on optimised techniques. The abundance of 
      thermophilic, alkalophilic and cellulose-degrading phylotypes suggests that these 
      organisms are responsible for maintaining the elevated temperature at the later 
      stages of the ATAD process.

AB  - While it is known that several Actinobacteria produce enzymes that decompose 
      polysaccharides or phenolic compounds in dead plant biomass, the occurrence of these 
      traits in the environment remains largely unclear. The aim of this work was to 
      screen isolated actinobacterial strains to explore their ability to produce 
      extracellular enzymes that participate in the degradation of polysaccharides and 
      their ability to cometabolically transform phenolic compounds of various 
      complexities. Actinobacterial strains were isolated from meadow and forest soils and 
      screened for their ability to grow on lignocellulose. The potential to transform 
      (14)C-labelled phenolic substrates (dehydrogenation polymer (DHP), lignin and 
      catechol) and to produce a range of extracellular, hydrolytic enzymes was 
      investigated in three strains of Streptomyces spp. that possessed high 
      lignocellulose degrading activity. Isolated strains showed high variation in their 
      ability to produce cellulose- and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes and were able to 
      mineralise up to 1.1% and to solubilise up to 4% of poplar lignin and to mineralise 
      up to 11.4% and to solubilise up to 64% of catechol, while only minimal 
      mineralisation of DHP was observed. The results confirm the potential importance of 
      Actinobacteria in lignocellulose degradation, although it is likely that the 
      decomposition of biopolymers is limited to strains that represent only a minor 
      portion of the entire community, while the range of simple, carbon-containing 
      compounds that serve as sources for actinobacterial growth is relatively wide.

AB  - The effect of copper (added as CuCl(2)) on the anaerobic co-digestion of Phragmites 
      straw and cow dung was studied in pilot experiments by investigating the biogas 
      properties, process stability, substrate degradation and enzyme activities at 
      different stages of mesophilic fermentation. The results showed that 30 and 100 mg/L 
      Cu(2+) addition increased the cumulative biogas yields by up to 43.62 and 20.77% 
      respectively, and brought forward the daily biogas yield peak, while 500 mg/L Cu(2+) 
      addition inhibited biogas production. Meanwhile, the CH(4) content in the 30 and 
      100 mg/L Cu(2+)-added groups was higher than that in the control group. Higher pH 
      values (close to pH 7) and lower oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) values in the 
      Cu(2+)-added groups after the 8th day indicated better process stability compared to 
      the control group. In the presence of Cu(2+), the degradation of volatile fatty 
      acids (VFAs) and other organic molecules (represented by chemical oxygen demand, 
      COD) generated from hydrolysis was enhanced, and the ammonia nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N) 
      concentrations were more stable than in the control group. The contents of lignin 
      and hemicellulose in the substrate declined in the Cu(2+)-added groups while the 
      cellulose contents did not. Neither the cellulase nor the coenzyme F(420) activities 
      could determine the biogas producing efficiency. Taking the whole fermentation 
      process into account, the promoting effect of Cu(2+) addition on biogas yields was 
      mainly attributable to better process stability, the enhanced degradation of lignin 
      and hemicellulose, the transformation of intermediates into VFA, and the generation 
      of CH(4) from VFA.

AB  - Recent developments in chemical pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass using 
      polyols as co-solvents (e.g., glycerol and ethylene glycol) at temperatures less 
      than 100°C may allow the effective use of thermostable and non-thermostable 
      cellulases in situ during the saccharification process. The potential of biomass 
      saccharifying enzymes, endoglucanases (EG) from a thermophilic bacterium (Thermotoga 
      maritima) and a mesophilic fungus (Trichoderma longibrachiatum), to retain their 
      activity in aqueous buffer, acidified glycerol, and acidified ethylene glycol used 
      as co-solvents at pretreatment temperatures at or below 100°C were examined. The 
      results show that despite its origin, T. longibrachiatum EG (Tl-EG) retained 75% of 
      its activity after exposure to 100°C for 5 min in aqueous buffer while T. maritima 
      EG (Tm-EG) retained only 5% activity. However, at 90°C both enzymes retained over 
      87% of their activity. In acidified (0.1% (w/w) H2SO4) glycerol, Tl-EG retained 
      similar activity (80%) to that obtained in glycerol alone, while Tm-EG retained only 
      35%. With acidified ethylene glycol under these conditions, both Tl-EG and Tm-EG 
      retained 36% of their activity. The results therefore show that Tl-EG is more stable 
      in both acidified glycerol and ethylene glycol than Tm-EG. A preliminary kinetic 
      study showed that pure glycerol improved the thermal stability of Tl-EG but 
      destabilized Tm-EG, relative to the buffer solution. The half-lives of both Tl-EG 
      and Tm-EG are 4.5 min in acidified glycerol, indicating that the effectiveness of 
      these enzymes under typical pretreatment times of greater than 15 min will be 
      considerably diminished. Attempts have been made to explain the differences in the 
      results obtained between the two enzymes.

TI  - [Screening of two straw-cellulose degrading actinomycetes].
PG  - 1085-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to screen microorganisms that could degrade 
      rice straw. METHODS: We used selective medium to screen strains and determined straw 
      fracture tension strength, weight loss, lignocellulose decomposition rate and 
      extracellular enzyme activity as re-screening methods after 10 days shake flask 
      culture. RESULTS: We isolated two antinomycetes (A3 and A6), the highest cellulose 
      enzyme activity of holoenzyme, beta3-Glucosidase, endonuclease and exonclease for A3 
      were 12.84, 6.23, 24.56 and 14.00 U/mL, and for A6 12.85, 6.53, 17.80 and 18.80 
      U/mL. The hemicelluloses enzyme activity was 83.05 for A3 and 52.98 U/mL for A6. 
      Both strains belonged to Streptomyces. With 10 days' treatment, inoculated straws 
      showed a decrease of straw fracture tension strength by 62.67% (A3) and 66.67% (A6), 
      while weight loss of straw was 31.50% (A3) and 35.83% (A6). A3's decomposition rate 
      of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin was 38.73% , 33.16% and 20.68% , and 47.69% , 
      28.64% and 22.59% for A6. CONCLUSION: Antinomycetes A3 and A6 could degrad 
      cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.

TI  - Purification and characterization of nitroreductase from red alkaliphilic bacterium 
      Aquiflexum sp. DL6.
PG  - 249-54
AB  - Nitroaromatic compounds are toxic to living organisms. Most of them exhibit human 
      mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. Biotransformation and bioremediation processes 
      can convert these compounds into non-toxic compounds. Acclimatization of bacterial 
      strain Aquiflexum sp. DL6 with nitro-aromatics resulted in significant induction of 
      nitroreductase (EC 1.5.1.34). The enzyme was purified by the combination of 
      DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography with 80-fold purification 
      and 22% yield. Molecular weight of purified nitroreductase was estimated to be 29 
      kDa by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme characteristics were explored by varying the pH and 
      temperatures, and the optimum activity was found at pH 9.5 and 40 degrees C. It was 
      revealed that the substrate specificity of nitroreductase of Aquiflexum sp. DL6 was 
      wide for the most of the tested nitro-aromatic compounds. The kinetic parameters 
      like Michaelis constant and velocity maxima were determined with o-nitrophenol and 
      NADH as substrates.

TI  - Axenic Biofilm Formation and Aggregation by Synechocystis sp. Strain PCC 6803 Are 
      Induced by Changes in Nutrient Concentration and Require Cell Surface Structures.

LID - e02192-18
AB  - Phototrophic biofilms are key to nutrient cycling in natural environments and 
      bioremediation technologies, but few studies describe biofilm formation by pure 
      (axenic) cultures of a phototrophic microbe. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. 
      strain PCC 6803 (here Synechocystis) is a model microorganism for the study of 
      oxygenic photosynthesis and biofuel production. We report here that wild-type (WT) 
      Synechocystis caused extensive biofilm formation in a 2,000-liter outdoor nonaxenic 
      photobioreactor under conditions attributed to nutrient limitation. We developed a 
      biofilm assay and found that axenic Synechocystis forms biofilms of cells and 
      extracellular material but only when cells are induced by an environmental signal, 
      such as a reduction in the concentration of growth medium BG11. Mutants lacking cell 
      surface structures, namely type IV pili and the S-layer, do not form biofilms. To 
      further characterize the molecular mechanisms of cell-cell binding by Synechocystis, 
      we also developed a rapid (8-h) axenic aggregation assay. Mutants lacking type IV 
      pili were unable to aggregate, but mutants lacking a homolog to Wza, a protein 
      required for type 1 exopolysaccharide export in Escherichia coli, had a superbinding 
      phenotype. In WT cultures, 1.2× BG11 medium induced aggregation to the same degree 
      as 0.8× BG11 medium. Overall, our data support that Wza-dependent exopolysaccharide 
      is essential to maintain stable, uniform suspensions of WT Synechocystis cells in 
      unmodified growth medium and that this mechanism is counteracted in a 
      pilus-dependent manner under altered BG11 concentrations.IMPORTANCE Microbes can 
      exist as suspensions of individual cells in liquids and also commonly form 
      multicellular communities attached to surfaces. Surface-attached communities, called 
      biofilms, can confer antibiotic resistance to pathogenic bacteria during infections 
      and establish food webs for global nutrient cycling in the environment. Phototrophic 
      biofilm formation is one of the earliest phenotypes visible in the fossil record, 
      dating back over 3 billion years. Despite the importance and ubiquity of 
      phototrophic biofilms, most of what we know about the molecular mechanisms, genetic 
      regulation, and environmental signals of biofilm formation comes from studies of 
      heterotrophic bacteria. We aim to help bridge this knowledge gap by developing new 
      assays for Synechocystis, a phototrophic cyanobacterium used to study oxygenic 
      photosynthesis and biofuel production. With the aid of these new assays, we

TI  - Biodegradation and microbial community changes upon shrimp shell wastes amended in 
      mangrove river sediment.

AB  - Chitin, a homopolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues linked by beta 1-4 
      bonds, is the most abundant renewable natural resource after cellulose. It is widely 
      distributed in nature as the integuments of crustaceans and insects and as a 
      component of fungi and algae. This study investigated the effects of a bifunctional 
      chitinase/lysozyme-producing strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa K-187, on degradation of 
      shrimp shells and the survival conditions of bacterial strains in mangrove river 
      sediment of Tamsui River. The structures of the whole bacterial community of the 
      samples were measured by using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel 
      electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technique. Results show that three bacterial strains 
      (Acrobacter sp., Shewanella sp., and Marinobacterium sp.) which originated from the 
      mangrove river sediment were found predominant in the 6 days-incubation sample of P. 
      aeruginosa K-187 amended mangrove river sediment. Meanwhile, biomass, reducing 
      sugar, and total sugar were found highest in the 6 weeks-incubation sample of shrimp 
      shell powder and P. aeruginosa K-187-amended mangrove river sediment. According to 
      the results, we assumed that the amendment of P. aeruginosa K-187 can enhance the 
      biodegradation of shrimp shells in the seawater containing mangrove river sediment. 
      We hope that these findings may provide some useful information for the reclamation 
      of chitin-containing wastes in our environment.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of Pseudomonas sp. from subarctic tundra soil: pathway 
      description and gene discovery for humic acids degradation.
PG  - 315-323
LID - 10.1007/s12223-017-0573-0 [doi]
AB  - Although humic acids (HA) are involved in many biological processes in soils and 
      thus their ecological importance has received much attention, the degradative 
      pathways and corresponding catalytic genes underlying the HA degradation by bacteria 
      remain unclear. To unveil those uncertainties, we analyzed transcriptomes extracted 
      from Pseudomonas sp. PAMC 26793 cells time-dependently induced in the presence of HA 
      in a lab flask. Out of 6288 genes, 299 (microarray) and 585 (RNA-seq) were 
      up-regulated by > 2.0-fold in HA-induced cells, compared with controls. A 
      significant portion (9.7% in microarray and 24.1% in RNA-seq) of these genes are 
      predicted to function in the transport and metabolism of small molecule compounds, 
      which could result from microbial HA degradation. To further identify lignin (a 
      surrogate for HA)-degradative genes, 6288 protein sequences were analyzed against 
      carbohydrate-active enzyme database and a self-curated list of putative lignin 
      degradative genes. Out of 19 genes predicted to function in lignin degradation, 
      several genes encoding laccase, dye-decolorizing peroxidase, vanillate O-demethylase 
      oxygenase and reductase, and biphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase were up-regulated > 2.0-fold 
      in RNA-seq. This induction was further confirmed by qRT-PCR, validating the likely 
      involvement of these genes in the degradation of HA.

TI  - Biological pretreatment with two bacterial strains for enzymatic hydrolysis of 
      office paper.
PG  - 424-8
AB  - The cellulose-hydrolyzing strains, Sphingomonas paucimobilis MK1 and Bacillus 
      circulans MK2, were separated from soil and were grown together in a single culture 
      plate. Growth B. circulans MK2 in liquid culture required symbiosis with S. 
      paucimobilis MK1. Biological pretreatment with the combined strain suspension after 
      the liquid culture improved enzymatic hydrolysis of office paper from municipal 
      wastes. Sugar recovery by S. paucimobilis MK1 (51%) was 1.4 times higher than that 
      of the untreated sample (30%) and in the strain combination with B. circulans MK2, 
      recovery was further improved by 2.5 times (75%). The sugar recovery in maximum 
      condition was enhanced up to 94% for office paper. Furthermore, biological 
      pretreatment effects were confirmed for more than 1 day less time. In X-ray 
      diffraction patterns for the crystallinity of cellulose in office paper changed 
      after biological pretreatment, the crystallinity was increased in comparison to that 
      in untreated paper. The mechanism of biological pretreatment effect was explained by 
      the fact that the strain acted as an endoglucanase, which hydrolyzes amorphous areas 
      randomly.

TI  - Characterisation and optimisation of three potential aerobic bacterial strains for 
      kraft lignin degradation from pulp paper waste.
PG  - 839-46
AB  - Eight aerobic bacterial strains were isolated from pulp paper mill effluent sludge. 
      Out of eight through nutrient enrichment technique three potential aerobic bacterial 
      strains ITRC S(6), ITRC S(7) and ITRC S(8) were found capable to effectively degrade 
      the kraft lignin (KL), a major byproduct of the chemical pulping process and main 
      contributor to the colour and toxicity of effluent. Further, these potential strains 
      (ITRC S(6), ITRC S(7) and ITRC S(8)) were biochemically characterised as Gram 
      variable small rod, Gram negative rod and Gram positive rod respectively. 
      Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing showed 95% base sequence homology and it was 
      identified as Paenibacillus sp. (AY952466), Aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus 
      (AY856831), Bacillus sp. (AY952465) for ITRC S(6), IITRC S(7) and ITRC S(8), 
      respectively. In batch decolourization experiments Bacillus sp. ITRC S(8) reduced 
      the colour of lignin amended mineral salt medium, pH 7.6 by 65% after 6th d, at 30 
      degrees C, A. aneurinilyticus ITRC S(7) by 56% and Paenibacillus ITRC S(6) 43%. 
      Under these conditions the three strains degraded the KL by 37%, 33% and 30%, 
      respectively while the mixed culture of these three bacteria reduced colour by 69%, 
      lignin by 40% and total substrate by 50% under same conditions. Biodegradation of 
      the KL was not affected by low (<0.2 mg l(-1)) dissolved oxygen content; thus oxygen 
      inhibition is more likely to be a metabolism-dependent event. Initially with 48 h 
      incubation the decolourization was slow with decreased pH. Further incubation there 
      was rapid decolourization with slight increase in pH at 6d compared with initial pH 
      by increasing culture optical density. The lignin analysis from medium with HPLC 
      indicated complete degradation rather than biotransformation with complete loss of 
      absorbance peak at 280 nm.

TI  - History of adaptation determines short-term shifts in performance and community 
      structure of hydrogen-producing microbial communities degrading wheat straw.
PG  - 1569-1580
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.12678 [doi]
AB  - This study addresses the question of ecological interest for the determination of 
      structure and diversity of microbial communities that degrade lignocellulosic 
      biomasses to produce biofuels. Two microbial consortia with different history, 
      native of wheat straw (NWS) and from a methanogenic digester (MD) fed with cow 
      manure, were contrasted in terms of hydrogen performance, substrate disintegration 
      and microbial diversity. NWS outperformed the hydrogen production rate of MD. 
      Microscopic images revealed that NWS acted on the cuticle and epidermis, generating 
      cellulose strands with high crystallinity, while MD degraded deeper layers, equally 
      affecting all polysaccharides. The bacterial composition markedly differed according 
      to the inocula origin. NWS almost solely comprised hydrogen producers of the phyla 
      Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, with 38% members of Enterococcus. After hydrogen 
      fermentation, NWS comprised 8% Syntrophococcus, an acetogen that cleaves aryl ethers 
      of constituent groups on the aromatic components of lignin. Conversely, MD comprised 
      thirteen phyla, primarily including Firmicutes with H(2) -producing members, and 
      Bacteroidetes with non-H(2) -producing members, which reduced the hydrogen 
      performance. Overall, the results of this study provide clear evidence that the 
      history of adaptation of NWS enhanced the hydrogen performance from untreated wheat 
      straw. Further, native wheat straw communities have the potential to refine 
      cellulose fibers and produce biofuels simultaneously.

TI  - Kraft Lignin Biodegradation by Dysgonomonas sp. WJDL-Y1, a New Anaerobic Bacterial 
      Strain Isolated from Sludge of a Pulp and Paper Mill.

AB  - Wastewater containing kraft lignin (KL) discharged from pulp and paper industries 
      could cause serious environmental contamination. Appropriate effluent treatment is 
      required to reduce the pollution. Investigations on anaerobic bacteria capable of 
      degrading KL are beneficial to both lignin removal and biofuel regeneration from the 
      effluent. In this paper, an anaerobic strain capable of degrading KL was isolated 
      from the sludge of a pulp and paper mill and identified as Dysgonomonas sp. WJDL-Y1 
      by 16S rRNA analysis. Optimum conditions for KL degradation by strain WJDL-Y1 were 
      obtained at initial pH of 6.8, C:N ratio of 6 and temperature of 33°C, based on 
      statistical analyses by response surface methodology. For a 1.2 g/l KL solution, a 
      COD removal rate of 20.7% concomitant with biomass increase of 17.6% was achieved 
      after 4 days of incubation under the optimum conditions. After the treatment by 
      strain WJDL-Y1, KL was modified and degraded.

TI  - Dynamic changes in the composite microbial system MC1 during and following its rapid 
      degradation of lignocellulose.
PG  - 951-62
AB  - To monitor the dynamics of the composite microbial system MC1 during its degradation 
      of lignocellulose and to improve our understanding of the microbial communities 
      involved in this biomass conversion, MC1 was characterized at eight time points over 
      an 18-day, thermophilic, aerobic, static cultivation. We found the microbial 
      communities to be dynamic, rhythmic consortia capable of changing in response to 
      lignocellulose degradation. The growth curve over 18 days was M-shaped. Based on the 
      quantitative changes in five major components of MC1 (Clostridium straminisolvens 
      CSK-1, Clostridium sp. FG4, Pseudoxanthomonas sp. M1-3, Brevibacillus sp. M1-5, and 
      Bordetella sp. M1-6), reduction in rice straw weight, cellulase (CMCase) activity, 
      xylanase activity, and changes in medium pH, we found that the process comprised two 
      identifiable phases. Rapid degradation occurred from day 0 to day 9, while the 
      post-rapid degradation phase included days 10 to 18. Day 3 and day 12 were two key 
      time points in the rapid degradation phase and post-rapid degradation phase, 
      respectively. Two anaerobes, C. straminisolvens CSK-1 and Clostridium sp. FG4, 
      dominated the MC1 system from day 0 to day 18.

TI  - Metagenomic and Proteomic Analyses of a Mangrove Microbial Community Following Green 
      Macroalgae Enteromorpha prolifera Degradation.
PG  - 2127-2137
LID - 10.4014/jmb.1607.07025 [doi]
AB  - A mangrove microbial community was analyzed at the gene and protein levels using 
      metagenomic and proteomic methods with the green macroalgae Enteromorpha prolifera 
      as the substrate. Total DNA was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 PE-100 
      platform. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for proteomic analysis. The 
      metagenomic data revealed that the orders Pseudomonadales, Rhizobiales, and 
      Sphingomonadales were the most prevalent in the mangrove microbial community. By 
      monitoring changes at the functional level, proteomic analyses detected ATP synthase 
      and transporter proteins, which were expressed mainly by members of the phyla 
      Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Members of the phylum Proteobacteria expressed a 
      high number of sugar transporters and demonstrated specialized and efficient 
      digestion of various glycans. A few glycoside hydrolases were detected in members of 
      the phylum Firmicutes, which appeared to be the main cellulose-degrading bacteria. 
      This is the first report of multiple "omics" analysis of E. prolifera degradation. 
      These results support the fact that key enzymes of glycoside hydrolase family were 
      expressed in large quantities, indicating the high metabolic activity of the 
      community.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacterial strains Paenibacillus sp. and Bacillus 
      sp. for kraft lignin decolorization from pulp paper mill waste.
PG  - 399-407
AB  - Eight aerobic bacterial strains were isolated from pulp paper mill waste and 
      screened for tolerance of kraft lignin (KL) using the nutrient enrichment technique 
      in mineral salt media (MSM) agar plate (15 g/L) amended with different 
      concentrations of KL (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 ppm) along with 1% glucose and 
      0.5% peptone (w/v) as additional carbon and nitrogen sources. The strains ITRC S6 
      and ITRC S8 were found to have the most potential for tolerance of the highest 
      concentration of KL. These organisms were characterized by biochemical tests and 
      further 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequencing, which showed 96.5% and 95% sequence 
      similarity of ITRC S(6) and ITRC S(8) and confirmed them as Paenibacillus sp. and 
      Bacillus sp., respectively. KL decolorization was routinely monitored with a 
      spectrophotometer and further confirmed by HPLC analysis. Among eight strains, ITRC 
      S(6) and ITRC S(8) were found to degrade 500 mg/L of KL up to 47.97% and 65.58%, 
      respectively, within 144 h of incubation in the presence of 1% glucose and 0.5% 
      (w/v) peptone as a supplementary source of carbon and nitrogen. In the absence of 
      glucose and peptone, these bacteria were unable to utilize KL. The analysis of 
      lignin degradation products by GC-MS analysis revealed the formation of various 
      acids as lignin monomers which resulted in a decrease in pH and a major change in 
      the chromatographic profile of the bacterial degraded sample as compared to the 
      control clear indications of biochemical modification of KL due to the bacterial 
      ligninolytic system by ITRC S(6), namely, acetic acid, propanoic acid, butanoic 
      acid, guaiacol, hexanoic acid, and ITRC S(8), namely acetic acid, propanoic acid, 
      ethanedioic acid, furan carboxylic acid, 2-propanoic acid, butanoic acid, 
      3-acetoxybutyric acid, propanedioic acid, acetoguiacone, 1,2,3-thiadiazole, 
      5-carboxaldixime, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenol, and dibutyl phthalate, indicating 
      the bacterium characteristic to degrade G and S units of lignin polymer.

TI  - [Isolation and identification of a cellulose degrading fungus Y5 and its capability 
      of degradating wheat straw].
PG  - 247-52
AB  - In order to promote the decomposition of crop straw and return it to soil rapidly 
      and solve the problems such as the waste of straw resources and pollution, we 
      screened the bacterial or fungi with high-efficient degradation of straw 
      lignocelluloses and studied its capability of degradating wheat straw. An isolate of 
      filamentous fungus with higher cellulase activity and ability to decompose CMC and 
      straw lignocellulose was screened from black soil samples taken from Heilongjiang 
      province by using the soil dilution, plating and liquid culture methods. 
      Morphological status on various media, and ITS rDNA sequences homology analysis were 
      performed to identify the taxonomy of the isolate. The effects of different time, 
      different N resources, different cellulose resources and different pH values on 
      enzyme activities produced by fungus was analyzed, and The ability of wheat straw 
      degradation of Y5 was determinated by using weight loss method and liquid culture. 
      The fungus was identified as Penicillium ochrochloron and named Y5. Filter paper 
      activity (FPA) and endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase (EG) were both reached the maximum 
      after the first fourth day inoculated, averaged 53 IU/mL and 55 IU/mL, respectively, 
      which were 22.6% and 18.2% higher than that of strain Trichoderma viride (AS3. 
      3711), respectively. Enzyme activities were the highest under the condition of wheat 
      straw used as C resources, which were 27.5% and 24.8% higher than that of AS3. 3711. 
      The FPA and EG activities were 35.7% and 14.9% higher than the AS3. 3711 strain with 
      NaNO3 as nitrogen source. The optimal pH value of liquid culture was 6. The 
      cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents were degraded by 43.5%, 49.7% and 9.3% 
      after the first 10 days inoculated, respectively, which indicated that Y5 had strong 
      enzyme activities on degradation of cellulose and hemicelluloses of wheat straw. The 
      Penicillium ochrochloron Y5 has strong ability of wheat straw cellulose degradation, 
      and its cellulase activities are higher than some published researches. The 
      Penicillium ochrochloron Y5 strain has the great potential in research and 
      development for inoculant of crop straw decomposition.

AB  - Soil amendments of wheat straw biochar (BC), lignocellulosic substrate (LS), BC+LS, 
      and BC+LS+BR (surfactant Brij30) were investigated for the first time in order to 
      remedy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-polluted soil using pilot scale 
      microcosm incubation. We hypothesized that the removal of PAHs could be inhibited 
      due to the adsorption and immobilization of biochar and the inhibition depends on 
      the molecular-weight of PAHs. The removal rates of phenanthrene (PHE) and 
      Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) ranked as C=BC>LS=LS+BC=LS+BC+BR and C=BC=LS+BC+BR>LS=LS+BC. 
      Wheat straw biochar inhibited the removal of PHE and accelerated BaP removal. The 
      activity of Dehydrogenase (DH) was depressed by the addition of the biochar while 
      the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was stimulated. Lignocellulose and 
      surfactant are favourable to sustain soil microbiological activity and the removal 
      of PAHs although the diversity of bacterial community was not significantly changed. 
      The findings implied that the components of PAHs are necessary to consider when the 
      amendments are implemented by associated biochar in PAH-polluted soil.

TI  - Detoxification of the organophosphate nerve agent coumaphos using organophosphorus 
      hydrolase immobilized on cellulose materials.
PG  - 554-60
AB  - Neurotoxic organophosphates (OPs) are widely used as pesticides and for public 
      health purposes, as well as being nerve gases. As a result of the widespread use of 
      these compounds for agriculture, large volumes of wastewater are generated. 
      Additionally, there are large stockpiles of the nerve gases soman, sarin and VX in 
      the United States and elsewhere around the world. Organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) 
      is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of OP nerve agents. To date, however, the 
      use of this enzyme in detoxification processes has been rather limited due to the 
      high cost of its purification and short catalytic half-life. This paper reports the 
      development of a cost-effective method for the production and immobilization of OPH 
      in a pilot application in an enzyme bioreactor column for detoxification of paraoxon 
      and coumaphos in contaminated wastewaters. A fusion between OPH and a cellulose 
      binding domain that binds selectively to cellulose was generated to allow one-step 
      purification and immobilization of OPH on cheap and abundantly available cellulose 
      immobilization matrices. When packed in a column bioreactor, the immobilized fusion 
      enzyme was able to completely degrade coumaphos up to a concentration of 0.2 mM. 
      However, stirring of OPH immobilized on cellulose materials resulted in complete OP 
      degradation of 1.5 mM coumaphos. The bioreactor column degraded the compounds tested 
      at high concentration, rapidly, and without loss of process productivity for about 2 
      months.

TI  - Biodegradation of fibrillated oil palm trunk fiber by a novel thermophilic, 
      anaerobic, xylanolytic bacterium Caldicoprobacter sp. CL-2 isolated from compost.

AB  - Oil palm trunk (OPT) is one of the most promising lignocellulosic bioresources. To 
      develop effective biodegradation, thermophilic, anaerobic microorganisms were 
      screened from bovine manure compost using fibrillated OPT (f-OPT) pretreated by wet 
      disk milling as the substrate. One thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium, strain CL-2, 
      whose 16S rDNA gene has 98.6% sequence identity with that of Caldicoprobacter 
      faecale DSM 20678(T), exhibited high degradation activity (32.7% reduction in total 
      dry solids of f-OPT). Strain CL-2 did not use cellulose as a carbon source, but used 
      hemicelluloses such as xylan, arabinoxylan, starch and pectin at 70 °C. Phylogenetic 
      and morphologic analyses and the polysaccharide use suggest that CL-2 may be 
      classified as a novel species of Caldicoprobacter, named Caldicoprobacter sp. CL-2. 
      To characterize enzymatic activities of CL-2, extracellular enzymes were prepared 
      from culture broth using beechwood xylan as the carbon source. The extracellular 
      enzymes showed high xylanase activity, but low cellulase activity, suggesting that 
      f-OPT degradation may depend on xylanase activity. To understand the xylanase system 
      of CL-2, a major xylanase was cloned and characterized. The xylanase (CalXyn11A) had 
      a modular structure consisting of a glycoside hydrolase (GH) family-11 domain and a 
      family 36 carbohydrate-binding module. CalXyn11A did not show f-OPT degradation 
      activity, but a strong synergistic effect was observed when CalXyn11A was added to 
      the extracellular enzyme preparation. These results indicate that, rather than 
      working alone, CalXyn11A has an important role in enhancing total lignocellulose 
      degradation activity by cooperation with other GHs.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the potential of bioaugmentation with 
      cellulolytic rumen microbiota to enhance the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic 
      feedstock. An anaerobic cellulolytic culture was enriched from sheep rumen fluid 
      using wheat straw as substrate under mesophilic conditions. To investigate the 
      effects of bioaugmentation on methane production from straw, the enrichment culture 
      was added to batch reactors in proportions of 2% (Set-1) and 4% (Set-2) of the 
      microbial cell number of the standard inoculum slurry. The methane production in the 
      bioaugmented reactors was higher than in the control reactors. After 30 days of 
      batch incubation, the average methane yield was 154 mL(N) CH(4) g(VS)(-1) in the 
      control reactors. Addition of 2% enrichment culture did not enhance methane 
      production, whereas in Set-2 the methane yield was increased by 27%. The bacterial 
      communities were examined by 454 amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, while 
      terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting of mcrA 
      genes was applied to analyze the methanogenic communities. The results highlighted 
      that relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae increased during the 
      enrichment. However, Cloacamonaceae, which were abundant in the standard inoculum, 
      dominated the bacterial communities of all batch reactors. T-RFLP profiles revealed 
      that Methanobacteriales were predominant in the rumen fluid, whereas the enrichment 
      culture was dominated by Methanosarcinales. In the batch rectors, the most abundant 
      methanogens were affiliated to Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales. Our 
      results suggest that bioaugmentation with sheep rumen enrichment cultures can 
      enhance the performance of digesters treating lignocellulosic feedstock.

TI  - Biosynthesis of poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoates by Sphingopyxis chilensis S37 and 
      Wautersia sp. PZK cultured in cellulose pulp mill effluents containing 
      2,4,6-trichlorophenol.
PG  - 397-401
AB  - Poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA) polymer is synthesized by different bacterial 
      species. There has been considerable interest in the development and production of 
      biodegradable polymers; however, the high cost of PHA production has restricted its 
      applications. Kraft cellulose industry effluents containing 2,4,6-trichlorophenol 
      (10 or 20 microg ml(-1)) were used by the bacteria Sphingopyxis chilensis S37 and 
      Wautersia sp. PZK to synthesize PHA. In this condition, S. chilensis S37 was able to 
      grow and degrade 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (ca. 60%) and 80% of these cells accumulated 
      PHA. Wautersia PZK completely degraded 2,4,6-TCP and more than 90% of the cells 
      accumulated PHA in 72 h. The PHA detection was performed by flow cytometry and 
      polyester composition was characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy 
      (GC-MS), indicating that these polymers are made by 3-hydroxybutyric acid and 
      3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid for S37 and PZK strains, respectively. Results 
      demonstrated that strains' growth and PHA production and composition are not 
      modified in cellulose effluents with or without 2,4,6-TCP (10-20 microg ml(-1)). 
      Therefore, our results indicate that S. chilensis S37 and Wautersia sp. PZK are able

TI  - [Effects of multi-stage strengthening inoculation on bacterial community diversity 
      during composting].
PG  - 2689-95
AB  - Effects of multi-stage strengthening inoculation on bacterial community diversity 
      were analyzed using PCR-DGGE method in municipal solid waste composting combined 
      with Cluster analysis and changes of Shannon-Weaver index, and the changes of 
      lignocellulose's degradation rate were also detected during the process. The results 
      showed that Multi-stage inoculation of composting can improve the temperature of 
      cooling and the secondary fermentation period. And the hemicellulose, cellulose and 
      lignin degradation rate increased by 7.19%, 10.89% and 8.98% compared to general 
      inoculation composting. The analysis of bacterial community diversity indicated that 
      the diversity index of the two inoculation showed significant differences, the 
      microbial inoculation could live well in the pile. It could avoid competition 
      between different inoculated agents and competition between inoculated and 
      indigenous microorganisms, and could improve bacterial community diversity during 
      composting especially for maturity stage. It could speed up the composting process 
      of stabilization.

TI  - Biological detoxification of Cr(VI) using wood-husk immobilized Acinetobacter 
      haemolyticus.
PG  - 164-71
AB  - Acinetobacter haemolyticus, a Gram-negative aerobic locally isolated bacterium, 
      immobilized on wood-husk showed the ability to detoxify Cr(VI) to Cr(III). 
      Wood-husk, a natural cellulose-based support material, packed in an upward-flow 
      column was used as support material for bacterial attachment. Around 97% of the 
      Cr(VI) in wastewater containing 15 mg L(-1) of Cr(VI) was reduced at a flow rate of 
      8.0 mL min(-1). The wastewater containing Cr(VI) was added with liquid pineapple 
      wastewater as nutrient source for the bacteria. Electron microscopic examinations of 
      the wood-husk after 42 days of column operation showed gradual colonization of the 
      wood-husk by bacterial biofilm. The use of 0.1% (v/v) formaldehyde as a disinfecting 
      agent inhibited growth of bacteria present in the final wastewater discharge. This 
      finding is important in view of the ethical code regarding possible introduction of 
      exogenous bacterial species into the environment.

TI  - Differences in the sensitivity of fungi and bacteria to season and invertebrates 
      affect leaf litter decomposition in a Mediterranean stream.
LID - fiw121 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiw121 [doi]
AB  - Microorganisms are key drivers of leaf litter decomposition; however, the mechanisms 
      underlying the dynamics of different microbial groups are poorly understood. We 
      investigated the effects of seasonal variation and invertebrates on fungal and 
      bacterial dynamics, and on leaf litter decomposition. We followed the decomposition 
      of Populus nigra litter in a Mediterranean stream through an annual cycle, using 
      fine and coarse mesh bags. Irrespective of the season, microbial decomposition 
      followed two stages. Initially, bacterial contribution to total microbial biomass 
      was higher compared to later stages, and it was related to disaccharide and lignin 
      degradation; in a later stage, bacteria were less important and were associated with 
      hemicellulose and cellulose degradation, while fungi were related to lignin 
      decomposition. The relevance of microbial groups in decomposition differed among 
      seasons: fungi were more important in spring, whereas in summer, water quality 
      changes seemed to favour bacteria and slowed down lignin and hemicellulose 
      degradation. Invertebrates influenced litter-associated microbial assemblages 
      (especially bacteria), stimulated enzyme efficiencies and reduced fungal biomass. We 
      conclude that bacterial and fungal assemblages play distinctive roles in microbial 
      decomposition and differ in their sensitivity to environmental changes, ultimately 
      affecting litter decomposition, which might be particularly relevant in highly 
      seasonal ecosystems, such as intermittent streams.

TI  - Characterization of non-discriminating tetramethylammonium hydroxide-induced 
      thermochemolysis-capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as a method for 
      profiling fatty acids in bacterial biomasses.
PG  - 99-109
AB  - Thermochemolysis using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) as a method for 
      profiling fatty acids (FAs) as methyl esters (FAMEs) was studied with respect to 
      discrimination of bacterial fatty acid patterns in Gram-negative Pseudomonas putida 
      in comparison with patterns obtained by classical preparation schemes (pressurized 
      solvent extraction, alkaline saponification). A new, non-discriminating pyrolysis 
      approach was used in these experiments. In this method, pyrolysis is carried out 
      inside a deactivated stainless steel capillary constituting a part of the column 
      train. This approach made it possible to distinguish analyte discrimination brought 
      about by (i) the pyrolyzer set-up in conventional pyrolysis and (ii) chemical 
      thermochemolysis reaction itself. Our results showed no significant discrimination 
      for saturated, monounsaturated and cyclopropane FAs when using thermochemolysis 
      temperatures up to 550 degrees C with the non-discriminating, capacitive-discharged 
      based approach. Likewise, the cis/trans ratio of monounsaturated FAs was preserved. 
      This is in sharp contrast to conventional pyrolysis systems (both Curie-point or 
      flash pyrolyzers) using much longer thermochemolysis times. When using these 
      systems, artificial monounsaturated FAMEs were formed during heat treatment 
      resulting in biased species identification/classification. Hydroxy-FAs, chiefly 
      bound covalently in lipopolysaccharides, could be almost quantitatively liberated by 
      TMAH using non-discriminating pyrolysis (beyond 90%), whereas the recoveries were 
      lower with conventional approaches. The new method makes it possible to profile 
      fatty acids in very small amounts of both solid and liquid samples without 
      significant sample preparation. This was exemplified by the results of 
      TMAH-thermochemolysis of a fermentation broth taken from an in situ bioremediation 
      reactor to monitor enhanced natural attenuation processes, and tomato roots which 
      were subjected to cellulolytic bacteria attacks (Streptomyces), resulting in 
      adsorption of these carboxymethyl-cellulose decomposing bacteria onto the root.

TI  - Sugarcane bagasse as support for immobilization of Bacillus pumilus HZ-2 and its use 
      in bioremediation of mesotrione-contaminated soils.
PG  - 10839-51
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-6935-0 [doi]
AB  - The degrading microorganisms isolated from environment usually fail to degrade 
      pollutants when used for bioremediation of contaminated soils; thus, additional 
      treatments are needed to enhance biodegradation. In the present study, the potential 
      of sugarcane bagasse as bacteria-immobilizing support was investigated in mesotrione 
      biodegradation. A novel isolate Bacillus pumilus HZ-2 was applied in bacterial 
      immobilization, which was capable of degrading over 95 % of mesotrione at initial 
      concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 mg L(-1) within 4 days in flask-shaking tests. 
      Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed that the bacterial cells were 
      strongly absorbed and fully dispersed on bagasse surface after immobilization. 
      Specially, 86.5 and 82.9 % of mesotrione was eliminated by bacteria immobilized on 
      bagasse of 100 and 60 mesh, respectively, which indicated that this immobilization 
      was able to maintain a high degrading activity of the bacteria. Analysis of the 
      degradation products determined 2-amino-4-methylsulfonylbenzoic acid (AMBA) and 
      4-methylsulfonyl-2-nitrobenzoic acid (MNBA) as the main metabolites in the 
      biodegradation pathway of mesotrione. In the sterile soil, approximately 90 % of 
      mesotrione was degraded after supplementing 5.0 % of molasses in bacteria-bagasse 
      composite, which greatly enhanced microbial adaptability and growth in the soil 
      environment. In the field tests, over 75 % of mesotrione in soil was degraded within 
      14 days. The immobilized preparation demonstrated that mesotrione could be degraded 
      at a wide range of pH values (5.0-8.0) and temperatures (25-35 °C), especially at 
      low concentrations of mesotrione (5 to 20 mg kg(-1)). These results showed that 
      sugarcane bagasse might be a good candidate as bacteria-immobilizing support to 
      enhance mesotrione degradation by Bacillus p. HZ-2 in contaminated soils.

      shown that hydrophobising agents based on drying oil turned out to be optimal (among 
      the other modifiers examined) for the preparation of sawdust carriers suitable for 
      the efficient immobilisation. The results obtained demonstrate promising 
      possibilities in developing a wide range of available and cheap, biodegradable 
      cellulose-containing carriers that possess varying surface hydrophobicity.

AB  - The increasing cultivation of genetically modified corn plants (Zea mays) during the 
      last decades is suggested as a potential risk to the environment. One of these 
      genetically modified variety expressed the insecticidal Cry1Ab protein originating 
      from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), resulting in resistance against Ostrinia 
      nubilalis, the European corn borer. Transgenic litter material is extensively 
      studied regarding the decomposition in soils. However, only a few field studies 
      analyzed the fate of the Cry1Ab protein and the impact of green and senescent leaf 
      litter from corn on the decomposition rate and related ecosystem functions in 
      aquatic environments. Consequently, a microbial litter decomposition experiment was 
      conducted under controlled semi-natural conditions in batch culture using two maize 
      varieties: one variety with Cry1Ab and another one with the appertaining Iso-line as 
      control treatment. The results showed no significant differences between the 
      treatment with Cry1Ab and the Iso-line regarding loss of total mass in dry weight of 
      43% for Iso-line and 45% for Bt-corn litter, lignin content increased to 137.5% 
      (Iso-line) and 115.7% (Bt-corn), and phenol loss decreased by 53.6% (Iso-line), 
      62.2% (Bt-corn) during three weeks of the experiment. At the end of the experiment 
      Cry1Ab protein was still detected with 6% of the initial concentration. A slightly 
      but significant lower cellulose content was found for the Cry1Ab treatment compared 
      to the Iso-line litter at the end of the experiment. The significant higher total 
      protein (25%) and nitrogen (25%) content in Bt corn, most likely due to the 
      additionally expression of the transgenic protein, may increase the microbial 
      cellulose degradation and decrease microbial lignin degradation. In conclusion a 
      relevant year by year input of protein and therefore nitrogen rich Bt corn litter 
      into aquatic environments may affect the balanced nutrient turnover in aquatic 
      ecosystems.

TI  - Biotransformation of the antibiotic agent flumequine by ligninolytic fungi and 
      residual antibacterial activity of the transformation mixtures.
PG  - 14128-36
LID - 10.1021/es403470s [doi]
AB  - Flumequine, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is applied preferably in veterinary 
      medicine, for stock breeding and treatment of aquacultures. Formation of drug 
      resistance is a matter of general concern when antibiotics such as flumquine occur 
      in the environment. Thus, biodegradation of flumequine in solution was investigated 
      using five different ligninolytic fungi. Irpex lacteus, Dichomitus squalens, and 
      Trametes versicolor proved most efficient and transformed more than 90% of 
      flumequine within 6 or even 3 days. Panus tigrinus and Pleurotus ostreatus required 
      up to 14 days to remove >90% of flumequine. Analyses of the metabolites by liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry suggest different transformation pathways for the 
      different fungal strains. Structure proposals were elaborated for 8 metabolites. 
      7-Hydroxy-flumequine and flumequine ethyl ester were identified as common 
      metabolites produced by all ligninolytic fungi. The largest variety of metabolites 
      was formed by D. squalens. Residual antibacterial activity of the metabolite 
      mixtures was tested using gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. While for the 
      less efficient P. tigrinus and P. ostreatus cultures the antibacterial activities 
      corresponded to the residual concentrations of flumequine, a remarkable 
      antibacterial activity remained in the D. squalens cultures although flumequine was 
      transformed to more than 90%. Obviously, antibacterially active transformation 
      products were formed by this fungal strain.

AB  - This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of bacteria from municipal 
      waste and peat to determine those bacteria with good potential for modification and 
      decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass for industrial application. Twenty 
      cellulase-producing bacteria belonging to four major phyla - Firmicutes, 
      Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes - were found when screened on 
      carboxymethyl cellulose-containing agar. Six isolates also exhibited activities 
      towards filter paper as the sole carbon source in salt media, while 12 exhibited 
      activities towards xylan when screened on xylan-containing plates. Moreover, 5 
      isolates survived in and increased the absorbance of 1% black liquor in salt media 
      by an average of 2.07-fold after 21 days of incubation. Similarly, these 5 isolates 
      increased the absorbance of 0.1% pure lignin at 280 nm in salt media, indicating 
      modification of lignin. Additionally, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 
      analysis of 1% barley straw treated for 21 days with these 5 strains showed a 
      preference for consumption of hemicelluloses over lignin; however, a change in 
      lignin was observed. A Bacillus strain (55S5) and a Pseudomonas strain (AS1) 
      displayed the greatest potential for lignocellulose decomposition due to a variety 
      of cellulase activities, as well as xylanase activity and modification of lignin. 
      Several of these isolates have good potential for industrial use in the degradation 
      of lignocellulosic biomass.

TI  - Bacterial degradation of synthetic and kraft lignin by axenic and mixed culture and 
      their metabolic products.
PG  - 991-9
AB  - Pulp paper mill effluent has high pollution load due to presence of lignin and its 
      derivatives as major colouring and polluting constituents. In this study, two lignin 
      degrading bacteria IITRL1 and IITRSU7 were isolated and identified as Citrobacter 
      freundii (FJ581026) and Citrobacter sp. (FJ581023), respectively. In degradation 
      study by axenic and mixed culture, mixed bacterial culture was found more effective 
      compared to axenic culture as it decolourized 85 and 62% of synthetic and kraft 
      lignin whereas in axenic conditions, bacterium IITRL1 and IITRSU7 decolourized 61 
      and 64% synthetic and 49 and 54% kraft lignin, respectively. Further, the mixed 
      bacterial culture also showed the removal of 71, 58% TOC; 78, 53% AOX; 70, 58% COD 
      and 74, 58% lignin from synthetic and kraft lignin, respectively. The ligninolytic 
      enzyme was characterized as manganese peroxidase by SDS-PAGE yielding a single band 
      of 43 KDa. The HPLC analysis of degraded samples showed reduction as well as 
      shifting of peaks compared to control indicating the degradation as well as 
      transformation of compounds. Further, in GC-MS analysis of synthetic and kraft 
      lignin degraded samples, hexadecanoic acid was found as recalcitrant compounds while 
      2,4,6-trichloro-phenol, 2,3,4,5-tetrachloro-phenol and pentachloro-phenol were 
      detected as new metabolites.

TI  - Structural and Biochemical Characterization of the Early and Late Enzymes in the 
      Lignin β-Aryl Ether Cleavage Pathway from Sphingobium sp. SYK-6.
PG  - 10228-38
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.700427 [doi]
AB  - There has been great progress in the development of technology for the conversion of 
      lignocellulosic biomass to sugars and subsequent fermentation to fuels. However, 
      plant lignin remains an untapped source of materials for production of fuels or high 
      value chemicals. Biological cleavage of lignin has been well characterized in fungi, 
      in which enzymes that create free radical intermediates are used to degrade this 
      material. In contrast, a catabolic pathway for the stereospecific cleavage of β-aryl 
      ether units that are found in lignin has been identified in Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 
      bacteria. β-Aryl ether units are typically abundant in lignin, corresponding to 
      50-70% of all of the intermonomer linkages. Consequently, a comprehensive 
      understanding of enzymatic β-aryl ether (β-ether) cleavage is important for future 
      efforts to biologically process lignin and its breakdown products. The crystal 
      structures and biochemical characterization of the NAD-dependent dehydrogenases 
      (LigD, LigO, and LigL) and the glutathione-dependent lyase LigG provide new insights 
      into the early and late enzymes in the β-ether degradation pathway. We present 
      detailed information on the cofactor and substrate binding sites and on the 
      catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes, comparing them with other known members of 
      their respective families. Information on the Lig enzymes provides new insight into 
      their catalysis mechanisms and can inform future strategies for using aromatic 
      oligomers derived from plant lignin as a source of valuable aromatic compounds for 
      biofuels and other bioproducts.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of various factors on the biodegradation of the 
      polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) phenanthrene and pyrene, and characterized 
      the structure of the microbial community in mangrove sediment from subtropical 
      Taiwan. The degradation of PAH was enhanced by the addition of brij 30, tween 80, 
      yeast extract, hydrogen peroxide, sodium chloride or cellulose. However, PAH 
      degradation was inhibited by the addition of humic acid, di-(2-ethylhexyl), 
      phthalate (DEHP) or nonylphenol. Our results also showed that the addition of 
      various substrates changed the microbial community in mangrove sediment. The strains 
      MS2 (Dyella ginsengisoli) and MS4 (Bacillus pumilus) were the constantly dominant 
      bacteria under various treatments in the mangrove sediment.

AB  - The composting process of six different compostable substrates and one of these with 
      the addition of bacterial inoculums carried out in a dynamic respirometer was 
      evaluated. Despite the heterogeneity of the compostable substrates, cumulative 
      oxygen demand (OD, mgO(2)kgVS) was fitted adequately to an exponential regression 
      growing until reaching a maximum in all cases. According to the kinetic constant of 
      the reaction (K) values obtained, the wastes that degraded more slowly were those 
      containing lignocellulosic material (green wastes) or less biodegradable wastes 
      (sewage sludge). The odor emissions generated during the composting processes were 
      also fitted in all cases to a Gaussian regression with R(2) values within the range 
      0.8-0.9. The model was validated representing real odor concentration near the 
      maximum value against predicted odor concentration of each substrate, (R(2)=0.9314; 
      95% prediction interval). The variables of maximum odor concentration (ou(E)/m(3)) 
      and the time (h) at which the maximum was reached were also evaluated statistically 
      using ANOVA and a post-hoc Tukey test taking the substrate as a factor, which 
      allowed homogeneous groups to be obtained according to one or both of these 
      variables. The maximum oxygen consumption rate or organic matter degradation during 
      composting was directly related to the maximum odor emission generation rate 
      (R(2)=0.9024, 95% confidence interval) when only the organic wastes with a low 
      content in lignocellulosic materials and no inoculated waste (HRIO) were considered. 
      Finally, the composting of OFMSW would produce a higher odor impact than the other 
      substrates if this process was carried out without odor control or open systems.

TI  - Biodegradation of kraft-lignin by Bacillus sp. isolated from sludge of pulp and 
      paper mill.
PG  - 783-92
AB  - Eight bacterial strains were isolated on kraft lignin (KL) containing mineral salt 
      medium (L-MSM) agar with glucose and peptone from the sludge of pulp and paper mill. 
      Out of these, ITRC-S8 was selected for KL degradation, because of its fast growth at 
      highest tested KL concentration and use of various lignin-related low molecular 
      weight aromatic compounds (LMWACs) as sole source of carbon and energy. The 
      bacterium was identified by biochemical tests as Gram-positive, rod-shaped and 
      non-motile. Subsequent 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed 95% base sequence homology 
      and it was identified as Bacillus sp. In batch experiments, a decrease in pH was 
      observed initially followed by an increase till it reached an alkaline pH, which did 
      not alter the culture growth significantly. The bacterium reduced the colour and KL 
      content of 500 mg l(-1 )KL in MSM, in the presence of glucose and peptone, at pH 
      7.6, temperature 30 degrees C, agitation of 120 rpm and 6 days of incubation by 65 
      and 37% respectively. Significant reduction in colour and KL content in subsequent 
      incubations is indicative of a co-metabolism mechanism, possibly due to initial 
      utilization of added co-substrates for energy followed by utilization of KL as a 
      co-metabolic. The degradation of KL by bacterium was confirmed by GC-MS analysis 
      indicating formation of several LMWACs such as t-cinnamic acid, 3, 4, 5-trimethoxy 
      benzaldehyde and ferulic acid as degradation products, which were not present in the 
      control (uninoculated) sample. This favours the idea of biochemical modification of 
      the KL polymer to a single monomer unit.

TI  - Wooden art objects and the museum environment: identification and biodegradative 
      characteristics of isolated microflora.
PG  - 87-94
AB  - AIMS: The identification of culturable microbial communities on wooden art objects 
      and from indoor air, and the analysis of their biodegradative properties. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: Common and newly-developed agar media were used for the isolation of 
      fungal and bacterial microflora. The identification was carried out by traditional 
      methods and by the sequencing of 16S or 18S rDNA PCR products. Different plate 
      assays were employed to screen the lignolytic and cellulolytic activities of the 
      isolated microflora. Interesting bacteria were isolated from art objects even though 
      the fungi were the principal contaminants of art works. Various fungal and bacterial 
      species exhibited their lignolytic and cellulolytic activity by the decolorization 
      of Remazol Brilliant Blue R, Phenol Red, Azure B and Ostazin Brilliant Red H-3B. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The microbial communities on wooden art objects exposed in an indoor 
      environment were identified. The study showed the biodegradative power of many 
      microorganisms, and new data were added to this field barely investigated. 
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: By the development of new culture media and 
      the evaluation of different biodegradative plate assays, a strategy for the analysis 
      of microflora in wooden art objects was established. Several aspects of the study 
      could be also exploited for biotechnology applications.

TI  - Investigation of the biotransformation of pentachlorophenol and pulp paper mill 
      effluent decolorisation by the bacterial strains in a mixed culture.
PG  - 5703-9
AB  - Mixed culture of two bacterial strains Bacillus sp. and Serratia marcescens showed 
      potential pentachlorophenol (PCP) degradation and decolorisation of pulp paper mill 
      effluent. The physico-chemical quality of pulp paper mill effluent has been analyzed 
      after 168 h incubation period degraded by mixed culture. The study revealed that it 
      has decreased high load of BOD, COD, TS, TDS, TSS, sulphate, phosphate, total 
      nitrogen, total phenols, metals and different salts (i.e. chloride, sodium, nitrate, 
      potassium) at 168 h incubation period. PCP degradation in pulp paper mill effluent 
      was confirmed by HPLC analysis. Mixed culture was found to degrade PCP up to (94%) 
      present in pulp paper mill effluent with 1% glucose and 0.5% peptone (w/v) at 30+/-1 
      degrees C, pH 8.0+/-0.2 at 120 rpm in 168 h incubation period. The simultaneous 
      release of chloride ion up to 1,200 mg/l at 168 h emphasized the bacterial 
      dechlorination in the medium. The pulp paper mill effluent degradation was also 
      supported by decline in pH, AOX (absorbable organic halides), color, D.O., BOD, COD 
      and PCP. The analysis of pulp paper mill effluent degradation products by GC-MS 
      analysis revealed the formation of low molecular weight compound like 2-chlorophenol 
      (RT=3.8 min) and tetrachlorohydroquinone (RT=11.86 min) from PCP extracted degraded 
      sample. Further, mixed culture may be used for bioremediation of PCP containing pulp 
      paper mill waste in the environment.

AB  - Bacterial communities associated with decomposing rhizomes of Phragmites australis 
      were investigated in Lake Ferto (Neusiedlersee, Hungary). Alkaliphilic and 
      alkalitolerant strains were isolated on cellulose-containing alkaline medium spread 
      with dilutions of scrapings taken from the surface of the decaying plant material. 
      Fifty-one strains were grouped by numerical analysis based on physiological tests 
      and BIOLOG sole carbon source utilization data. The strains identified by 16S rDNA 
      sequence comparisons included members of low G+C Gram positives (Marinibacillus 
      marinus, Bacillus cereus, and Exiguobacterium aurantiacum), high G+C Gram positives 
      (Nesterenkonia halobia and Dietzia natronolimnea), alpha-proteobacteria 
      (Pannonibacter phragmitetus), and gamma-proteobacteria (Pseudomonas 
      pseudoalcaligenes and Halomonas venusta). Most of the strains were characterized by 
      aerobic chemoorganotrophic respiratory metabolism and utilized several different 
      carbon sources, although no direct cellulolytic activity was observed. Results of 
      the pH and salt tolerance tests revealed optimuma in most cases at pH 11 and at the 
      presence of 2.5-5% NaCl. These bacteria probably occupy niches in the aerobic, 
      alkaline, water-influenced environments on the decomposing reed surfaces.

TI  - Investigation of microbial community isolated from indoor artworks and air 
      environment: identification, biodegradative abilities, and DNA typing.

AB  - This study deals with establishing the characteristics of a microbial community 
      isolated from indoor artworks and the surrounding air environment. It is one of the 
      few studies on microbial degradation of indoor artworks. It shows the potential 
      biodegradative risk that can occur if artworks are not exhibited and conserved in an 
      appropriate environment. The microbial community isolated from the indoor artworks 
      and air environment was examined by cultural and molecular methods. Different plate 
      assays were used to screen the biodegradative activity of the isolated microflora: 
      Remazol Brilliant Blue R, phenol red, and Azure B for the ligninolytic properties; 
      Ostazin brilliant red H-3B for cellulose degradation; CaCO3 glucose agar for 
      solubilization activity; and B4 agar for biomineralization. To type the bacterial 
      and fungal isolates, 2 PCR methods, repetitive extragenic palindromes (REP) and 
      random amplified microsatellite polymorphisms (RAMP) were used. The art objects were 
      principally colonized by fungi. The most commonly isolated strains were represented 
      by hyphomycetes of the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and 
      Chaetomium. Members of these genera showed intensive biodegradation activity, both 
      on wood and on stone. Bacteria were predominant in the air, exhibiting complex 
      communities, both in the air and on the artworks. The most frequently isolated 
      genera were Bacillus and Staphylococcus with extensive biodegradation abilities. 
      REP-PCR revealed high variability within strains belonging to the same genus. RAMP 
      is a new PCR-based method, used in this research for the first time to cluster the 
      microfilamentous fungi and to characterize and select especially Penicillium and 
      Aspergillus strains, which were isolated in a large number.

AB  - Introducing cellulases into Corynebacterium glutamicum leads to the direct 
      degradation of lignocellulosic materials for energy sources. In this study, a 
      cellulase complex containing two cellulolytic enzymes, endoglucanase E (CelE) and 
      β-glucosidase A (BglA), was established to completely degrade cellulose to glucose. 
      The cellulases complexes were displayed on the cell surface of C. glutamicum by 
      using the mechanosensitive channel (Msc) to anchor enzymes in the cytoplasmic 
      membrane. As confirmed by comparison enzyme activities in the cell pellet fraction 
      and supernatant and dual color based immunofluorescence microscopy, the cellulolytic 
      enzymes was successfully associated with the cell surface of C. glutamicum. The 
      displayed cellulases complexes had a synergic effect on the direct conversion of 
      biomass to reducing sugars leading to 3.1- to 6.0-fold increase compared to the 
      conversion by the secreted cellulases complexes. In addition, the displayed 
      cellulases complexes increased the residual activities of cCelE and cBglA at 70°C 
      from 28.3% and 24.3% in the secreted form to 65.1% and 82.8%, respectively. The 
      display of cellulases complexes on the cell surface of C. glutamicum enhances the 
      polysaccharide equivalent and the direct saccharification of low cost biomass via 
      the action of multi-thermostable enzyme complexes.

AB  - Throughout 90-day biodegradation under microaerobic conditions, invasive to 
      Lithuania species boxelder maple (Acer negundo) leaves lost 1.5-fold more biomass 
      than that of autochthonous black alder (Alnus glutinosa), releasing higher contents 
      of N(tot), ammonium and generating higher BOD(7). Boxelder maple leaf leachates were 
      characterized by higher total bacterial numbers and colony numbers of heterotrophic 
      and cellulose-decomposing bacteria than those of black alder. The higher toxicity of 
      A. negundo aqueous extracts and leachates to charophyte cell (Nitellopsis obtusa), 
      the inhabitant of clean lakes, were manifested at mortality and membrane 
      depolarization levels, while the effect on H(+)-ATPase activity in membrane 
      preparations from the same algae was stronger in case of A. glutinosa. Duckweed 
      (Lemna minor), a bioindicator of eutrophic waters, was more sensitive to leaf 
      leachates of A. glutinosa. Fallen leaves and leaf litter leachates from invasive and 
      native species of trees, which enter water body, affect differently microbial 
      biodestruction and aquatic vegetation in freshwater systems.

AB  - Gammaproteobacteria belonging and related to the genus Microbulbifer are an emerging 
      group of complex carbohydrate-degrading marine bacteria. Previously, all of the 
      representatives were placed within Microbulbifer or were unclassified. Recently, a 
      new genus, Teredinibacter, represented by a single species, Teredinibacter turnerae, 
      was formed to include an endosymbiotic branch of these organisms. In this study, 
      based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and phenotypic analyses, a new genus, 
      Saccharophagus, is proposed to accommodate the most versatile marine carbohydrate 
      degrader yet identified, Saccharophagus degradans gen. nov., sp. nov. 2-40(T) (=ATCC 
      43961(T)=DSM 17024(T)). S. degradans strain 2-40(T) can degrade 10 tested complex 
      polysaccharides: agar, alginate, chitin, cellulose, fucoidan, laminarin, pectin, 
      pullulan, starch and xylan. S. degradans 2-40(T) shares 90.5% 16S rRNA gene sequence 
      similarity with the type strain of the Microbulbifer type species, Microbulbifer 
      hydrolyticus IRE-31(T), and 91.5% with T. turnerae T7902(T), and can be further 
      distinguished from members of these two genera by 16S rRNA gene cluster analysis, 
      the ability to utilize 10 different complex polysaccharides as sole carbon sources, 
      a significantly lower G+C content and differences in fatty acid content. The three 
      genera of complex polysaccharide-degrading, marine bacteria now encompass 20 strains 
      from diverse marine niches.

TI  - Metagenomic SMRT Sequencing-Based Exploration of Novel Lignocellulose-Degrading 
      Capability in Wood Detritus from Torreya nucifera in Bija Forest on Jeju Island.

AB  - Lignocellulose, composed mostly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin generated 
      through secondary growth of woody plant, is considered as promising resources for 
      biofuel. In order to use lignocellulose as a biofuel, biodegradation besides 
      high-cost chemical treatments were applied, but knowledge on the decomposition of 
      lignocellulose occurring in a natural environment is insufficient. We analyzed the 
      16S rRNA gene and metagenome to understand how the lignocellulose is decomposed 
      naturally in decayed Torreya nucifera (L) of Bija forest (Bijarim) in Gotjawal, an 
      ecologically distinct environment. A total of 464,360 reads were obtained from 16S 
      rRNA gene sequencing, representing diverse phyla; Proteobacteria (51%), 
      Bacteroidetes (11%) and Actinobacteria (10%). The metagenome analysis using single 
      molecules real-time sequencing revealed that the assembled contigs determined 
      originated from Proteobacteria (58%) and Actinobacteria (10.3%). Carbohydrate Active 
      enZYmes (CAZy)- and Protein families (Pfam)-based analysis showed that 
      Proteobacteria was involved in degrading whole lignocellulose, and Actinobacteria 
      played a role only in a part of hemicellulose degradation. Combining these results, 
      it suggested that Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria had selective biodegradation 
      potential for different lignocellulose substrates. Thus, it is considered that 
      understanding of the systemic microbial degradation pathways may be a useful 
      strategy for recycle of lignocellulosic biomass, and the microbial enzymes in Bija 
      forest can be useful natural resources in industrial processes.

TI  - Compositional and moisture content effects on the biodegradability of 
      zein/ethylcellulose films.
PG  - 2230-5
AB  - The effect of moisture content and film composition on biodegradability is the focus 
      of this study. Flexible films were first characterized for the effect on water 
      sorption isotherms of relative humidity, temperature, zein content, and the addition 
      of the plasticizers stearic acid, poly(ethylene glycol), or etoxylated ricine oil. 
      Zein/ethylcellulose (EC) mixture films had a behavior between that for pure zein and 
      EC films, which had the lowest water sorption. For films with plasticizer, the 
      lowest water sorption at 25 degrees C was observed for those with stearic acid. 
      Biodegradability of zein/EC films, evaluated using bacterial cultures selected for 
      their zein proteolytic activity and isolated from a local solid waste landfill and a 
      lagoon, showed no plasticizer effect even though its effect on moisture content was 
      significant. Large differences were observed at different film zein concentration 
      with the highest biodegradability for 100% zein. However, biodegradability did not 
      mimic the water sorption behavior of zein/EC mixture films.

TI  - Isolation of a tannic acid-degrading Streptococcus sp. from an anaerobic shea cake 
      digester.
PG  - 46-50
AB  - An anaerobic digester fed with shea cake rich in tannins and phenolic compounds 
      rich-shea cake and previously inoculated with anaerobic sludge from the pit of a 
      slaughterhouse, enabled six months acclimatization of the bacteria to aromatic 
      compounds. Afterwards, digester waste water samples were subject to successive 
      culture on media with 1 g L(-1) tannic acid allowing the isolation of a bacterial 
      strain coded AB. Strain AB was facultatively anaerobic, mesophilic, non-motile, 
      non-sporulating, catalase and oxidase negative bacterium, namely strain AB, was 
      isolated from an anaerobic digester fed with shea cake rich in tannins and phenolic 
      compounds, after inoculation with anaerobic sludge from the pit of a slaughterhouse 
      and enrichment on tannic acid. The coccoid cells occurred in pair, short or long 
      chains and stained Gram-positive. Strain AB fermented a wide range of carbohydrates 
      including glucose, fructose, galactose, raffinose, arabinose, sucrose, maltose, 
      lactose, starch and cellulose. Optimum growth occurred with glucose and tannic acid 
      at 37 degrees C and pH 8. The pH, temperature and salt concentration for growth 
      ranged from 5 to 9, 20 to 45 degrees C and 0 to 15 g L(-1), respectively. Strain AB 
      converted tannic acid to gallic acid. These features were similar to those of the 
      Streptococcus genus. The determination of tannic acid hydrolysis end products, 
      ability to utilize various organic acids, alcohols and peptides, GC% of the DNA, the 
      sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and DNA-DNA hybridization will permit to confirm this 
      affiliation and to determine the species.

TI  - A previously uncultured, paper mill Propionibacterium is able to degrade O-aryl 
      alkyl ethers and various aromatic hydrocarbons.
PG  - 1287-93
LID - 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.03.032 [doi]
AB  - A previously uncultured Propionibacterium was isolated from a highly diluted sample 
      (10(-6)mL) of activated sludge of paper mill effluent. The isolate MOB600 was able 
      to grow on anisole, phenetole, benzene, toluene, phenol, styrene and biphenyl, 
      although it used only limited carbon sources in the minimal media. The partial DNA 
      sequence of 16S ribosomal RNA gene was 93% identical to Luteococcus peritoni 
      CCUG38120 as the closest neighborhood in the family Propionibacteriaceae. Strain 
      MOB600 produced 2-methoxyphenol and 2-ethoxyphenol seemingly in an unproductive 
      pathway from the degradation of anisole and phenetole, respectively. It had a 
      substrate preference to favor 3-alkoxyphenols over 2-alkoxyphenols. Formation of 
      3-hydroxylated O-aryl alkyl ether was substantially proved by the nearly 1:1 
      biotransformation of substrate-analogous 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene to 
      3,4-methylenedioxyphenol (sesamol) showing end-product inhibition. The strain 
      converted 2-/3-methoxyphenols to 3-methoxycatechol. The extradiol ring fission of 
      3-methoxycatechol appeared to take place in the production of a yellow-colored 
      2-hydroxymuconate derivative, thereby being able to release methanol spontaneously. 
      High specificity polymerase chain reaction screening for bacterial dioxygenases 
      revealed that the genomic DNA encoded at least three ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase 
      large subunits. Being consistent with substrate availability for this strain, the 
      obtained sequences were closely related to large subunits of an isopropylbenzene 
      2,3-dioxygenase, a benzene 1,2-dioxygenase, a biphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase, a benzoate 
      1,2-dioxygenase and a putative dioxygenase in Rhodococcus strains. Our results 
      demonstrate that strain MOB600 may play a major role in the degradation of 
      lignin-like O-aryl alkyl ethers and various aromatic hydrocarbon pollutants in 
      activated sludge of paper mill effluent.

TI  - A second 5-carboxyvanillate decarboxylase gene, ligW2, is important for 
      lignin-related biphenyl catabolism in Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6.
PG  - 5014-21
AB  - A lignin-related biphenyl compound, 5,5'-dehydrodivanillate (DDVA), is degraded to 
      5-carboxyvanillate (5CVA) by the enzyme reactions catalyzed by DDVA O-demethylase 
      (LigX), meta-cleavage oxygenase (LigZ), and meta-cleavage compound hydrolase (LigY) 
      in Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6. 5CVA is then transformed to vanillate by a 
      nonoxidative 5CVA decarboxylase and is further degraded through the protocatechuate 
      4,5-cleavage pathway. A 5CVA decarboxylase gene, ligW, was isolated from SYK-6 (X. 
      Peng, E. Masai, H. Kitayama, K. Harada, Y, Katayama, and M. Fukuda, Appl. Environ. 
      Microbiol. 68:4407-4415, 2002). However, disruption of ligW slightly affected the 
      5CVA decarboxylase activity and the growth rate on DDVA of the mutant, suggesting 
      the presence of an alternative 5CVA decarboxylase gene. Here we isolated a second 
      5CVA decarboxylase gene, ligW2, which consists of a 1,050-bp open reading frame 
      encoding a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 39,379 Da. The deduced amino acid 
      sequence encoded by ligW2 exhibits 37% identity with the sequence encoded by ligW. 
      Based on a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction product 
      from 5CVA catalyzed by LigW2 in the presence of deuterium oxide, LigW2 was indicated 
      to be a nonoxidative decarboxylase of 5CVA, like LigW. After disruption of ligW2, 
      both the growth rate on DDVA and the 5CVA decarboxylase activity of the mutant were 
      decreased to approximately 30% of the wild-type levels. The ligW ligW2 double mutant 
      lost both the ability to grow on DDVA and the 5CVA decarboxylase activity. These 
      results indicate that both ligW and ligW2 contribute to 5CVA degradation, although 
      ligW2 plays the more important role in the growth of SYK-6 cells on DDVA.

TI  - Optimized mixtures of recombinant Humicola insolens cellulases for the 
      biodegradation of crystalline cellulose.
PG  - 339-45
AB  - The digestion of bacterial cellulose ribbons by ternary mixtures of enzymes 
      consisting of recombinant cellulases (two cellobiohydrolases, Cel6A and Cel7A, and 
      the endoglucanase Cel45A) from Humicola insolens was investigated over a wide range 
      of mixture composition. The extent of digestion was followed by soluble sugar 
      release (saccharification) analysis together with transmission electron microscopy 
      (TEM) observations. It was found that the addition of minute quantities of Cel45A 
      induced a spectacular increase in saccharification of the substrate with either 
      Cel7A or the mixture of Cel6A and Cel7A. Conversely, only a moderate 
      saccharification resulted from the mixing of Cel45A and Cel6A. This difference is 
      believed to originate from (1) the occasional endo character of Cel6A and (2) the 
      competition of Cel6A and Cel45A for the substrate sites that are sensitive to endo 
      activity. Interestingly, the mixture of enzymes giving rise to the highest 
      saccharification rate did not always correspond to mixtures of enzymes generating 
      the highest synergy. TEM images revealed that the bacterial cellulose ribbons became 
      at the same time cut and narrowed down under the action of an optimized mixture of 
      the three enzymes.

TI  - Chemical characterisation of natural organic substrates for biological mitigation of 
      acid mine drainage.
PG  - 4186-96
AB  - The current approach of the biological treatment of acid mine drainage by means of a 
      passive remediation system involves the choice of an appropriate organic substrate 
      as electron donor for sulphate reducers. Nowadays this selection is one of the 
      critical steps in the performance of such treatment, as this depends to a great 
      extent on the degradability of the organic substrate. Thus, a prior characterisation 
      of the organic substrate predicting its biodegradability would be desirable before 
      embarking on an extensive large-scale application. The aim of this study was to 
      correlate the chemical composition (lignin content) of four different natural 
      organic substrates (compost, sheep and poultry manures, oak leaf) and their capacity 
      to sustain bacterial activity in an attempt to predict biodegradation from chemical 
      characterisation. The results showed that the lower the content of lignin in the 
      organic substrate, the higher its biodegradability and capacity for developing 
      bacterial activity. Of the four organic materials, sheep and poultry manures and oak 
      leaf evolved reducing conditions and sustained active sulphidogenesis, which coupled 
      with the decrease in sulphate concentration indicated bacterial activity. Sheep 
      manure was clearly the most successful organic material as electron donor (sulphate 
      removal >99%), followed by poultry manure and oak leaf (sulphate removal of 80%). 
      Compost appeared to be too poor in carbon to promote sulphate-reducing bacteria 
      activity by itself. Column experiments emphasised the importance of considering the 
      residence time as a key factor in the performance of continuous systems. With a 
      residence time of 0.73 days, sheep manure did not promote sulphidogenesis. However, 
      extending residence time to 2.4 and 9.0 days resulted in an increase in the sulphate 
      removal to 18% and 27%, respectively.

PG  - 721-5
AB  - Cellulose decomposing microorganisms (CDMs) are important for efficient 
      bioconversion of plant biomasses. To this end, we isolated seven fungal isolates 
      (Aspergillus wentii, Fusarium solani, Mucor sp., Penicillum sp., Trichoderma 
      harzaianum, Trichoderma sp.1 and Trichoderma sp.2) and three bacterial isolates 
      (bacterial isolate I, II and III) from partially decomposed farm yard manure, rice 
      straw and vermicompost, and evaluated them for decomposition of rice straw (Oryza 
      sativa), Ipomoea camea and Eichhornia crassipes biomass. CDMs inoculation, in 
      general, reduced the composting period by 14-28 days in rice straw, 14-34 days in 
      Eichhornia and 10-28 days in Ipomoea biomass over control. Of the 10 CDMs tested, 
      Mucor sp. was found to be the most effective as Mucor-inoculated biomass required 
      minimum time, i.e. 84, 68 and 80 days respectively for composting of rice straw, 
      Eichhornia and Ipomoea biomass as against 112, 102 and 108 days required under their 
      respective control. CDMs inoculation also narrowed down the C:N ratio of the 
      composts which ranged from 19.1-22.7, 12.9-14.7 and 10.5-13.1 in rice straw, 
      Eichhornia and Ipomoea biomass respectively as against 24.1, 17.1 and 16.2 in the 
      corresponding control treatments. Aspergillus wentii, Fusarium solani, Mucor sp., 
      and Penicillum sp. were found most effective (statistically at par) in reducing C:N 
      ratio and causing maximum loss of carbon and dry matter in composted materials. 
      These benefits of CDMs inoculation were also accompanied by significant increase in 
      NPK contents in the composted materials.

TI  - Isolation of a rice endophytic bacterium, Pantoea sp. Sd-1, with ligninolytic 
      activity and characterization of its rice straw degradation ability.
PG  - 123-9
LID - 10.1111/lam.12163 [doi]
AB  - This study focused on an endophytic bacterial strain, Pantoea sp. Sd-1, which can be 
      used to degrade lignin and rice straw. This strain was isolated from rice seeds by 
      an optimized surface sterilization method. Pantoea sp. Sd-1 showed exceptional 
      ability to degrade rice straw and lignin. In rice straw or kraft lignin-containing 
      medium supplemented with 1% glucose and 0.5% peptone, Pantoea sp. Sd-1 effectively 
      reduced the rice straw mass weight by 54.5% after 6 days of treatment. The strain 
      was also capable of reducing the lignin colour (52.4%) and content (69.1%) after 4 
      days of incubation. The findings suggested that the rice endophytic bacterium 
      Pantoea sp. Sd-1 could be applied for the degradation of lignocellulose biomass, 
      such as rice straw. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Rice straw, an abundant 
      agricultural by-product in China, is very difficult to degrade because of its high 
      lignin content. Due to the immense environmental adaptability and biochemical 
      versatility of bacteria, endophytic bacteria are useful resources for 
      biodegradation. In this study, we screened for endophytic bacteria capable of 
      biodegrading rice straw and lignin and obtained one strain, Pantoea sp. Sd-1, with 
      suitable characteristics. Sd-1 could be used for degradation of rice straw and 
      lignin, and may play an important role in biodegradation of this agricultural 
      by-product.

TI  - Assessing the efficiency of urban waste biocomposting by analytical pyrolysis 
      (Py-GC/MS).
PG  - 1304-9
LID - 10.1016/j.biortech.2008.06.067 [doi]
AB  - Analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS) was used to study complex composting processes. The 
      technique was first validated for reproducibility and finally applied to assess the 
      efficiency of a microbial bio-accelerator product (CBB) in composting organic 
      residues with different composition. Fresh lignocellulosic and urban wastes were 
      treated with CBB and the composting kinetics studied to investigate the 
      transformations undergone in the course of biocomposting. Our findings demonstrate 
      that these changes, as well as the efficiency of CBB, can be monitored through the 
      molecular characterization of the released pyrolysis products. The CBB bacterial 
      product effectively seems to favour composting accelerating the process and shorten 
      composting time. Analytical pyrolysis was informative in assessing to which extent 
      compost transformation reached an acceptable stabilization point. The technique 
      could be also developed into a semi-quantitative tool to monitor changes of main 
      organic matter components (polysaccharides, proteins, lignin, lipids, etc.) as 
      composting proceeds.

TI  - Strategies for pH control in a biofilter packed with sugarcane bagasse for hydrogen 
      sulfide removal.
PG  - 990-6
LID - 10.1080/10934529.2012.667308 [doi]
AB  - The biological removal of hydrogen sulfide at low concentration (<120 ppmv) was 
      studied in a laboratory-scale biofilter packed with sugarcane bagasse and inoculated 
      with a sulfur-oxidizing bacterial consortium isolated from activated sludge from a 
      wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Inlet loads from 1.31 to 20.2 g Sm(-3) h(-1) were 
      supplied to the biofilter, and empty bed residence times (EBRTs) of 30, 20 and 10 s 
      were tested. In all cases, the removal efficiency was greater than 99%. Two methods 
      for the pH control were tested: increasing the phosphate buffer capacity of the 
      mineral medium (method I), and a new method, which involves the addition of solid 
      CaCO(3) to the bagasse at the upper inlet of the biofilter (method II). For method 
      I, pH increased gradually along the bed (from the bottom to the top), from a 
      constant value of 3.0 to 7.0. For method II, pH was constant (2.4 ± 0.8) along the 
      bed, and then a steep increase of pH was observed at the top to 7.1. We suggest the 
      use of CaCO(3) instead of phosphate buffer because the former is less expensive, it 
      is a simple method and the results obtained with the two methods are similar.

TI  - Profile of secreted hydrolases, associated proteins, and SlpA in 
      Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum during the degradation of hemicellulose.
PG  - 5001-11
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00998-14 [doi]
AB  - Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum, a Gram-positive thermophilic anaerobic 
      bacterium, grows robustly on insoluble hemicellulose, which requires a specialized 
      suite of secreted and transmembrane proteins. We report here the characterization of 
      proteins secreted by this organism. Cultures were grown on hemicellulose, glucose, 
      xylose, starch, and xylan in pH-controlled bioreactors, and samples were analyzed 
      via spotted microarrays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Key hydrolases 
      and transporters employed by T. saccharolyticum for growth on hemicellulose were, 
      for the most part, hitherto uncharacterized and existed in two clusters (Tsac_1445 
      through Tsac_1464 for xylan/xylose and Tsac_1344 through Tsac_1349 for starch). A 
      phosphotransferase system subunit, Tsac_0032, also appeared to be exclusive to 
      growth on glucose. Previously identified hydrolases that showed strong conditional 
      expression changes included XynA (Tsac_1459), XynC (Tsac_0897), and a pullulanase, 
      Apu (Tsac_1342). An omnipresent transcript and protein making up a large percentage 
      of the overall secretome, Tsac_0361, was tentatively identified as the primary 
      S-layer component in T. saccharolyticum, and deletion of the Tsac_0361 gene resulted 
      in gross morphological changes to the cells. The view of hemicellulose degradation 
      revealed here will be enabling for metabolic engineering efforts in 
      biofuel-producing organisms that degrade cellulose well but lack the ability to 
      catabolize C5 sugars.

AB  - In this study we have investigated the molecular background of the previously 
      reported dye decolourization potential of Bacillus sp. LD003. Strain LD003 was 
      previously isolated on Kraft lignin and was able to decolourize various lignin model 
      dyes. Specifically Azure B (AB) was decolourized efficiently. Proteins possibly 
      involved in AB decolourization were partially purified, fractionated by gel 
      electrophoresis and identified via mass spectrometry. Five candidate enzymes were 
      selected and expressed in Escherichia coli. Of these, only a quinone dehydrogenase 
      was shown to decolourize AB. Thus, this quinone dehydrogenase was identified as an 
      AB decolourizing enzyme of Bacillus sp. LD003.

TI  - Decomposition rates and residue-colonizing microbial communities of Bacillus 
      thuringiensis insecticidal protein Cry3Bb-expressing (Bt) and non-Bt corn hybrids in 
      the field.
PG  - 839-46
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01954-10 [doi]
AB  - Despite the rapid adoption of crops expressing the insecticidal Cry protein(s) from 
      Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), public concern continues to mount over the potential 
      environmental impacts. Reduced residue decomposition rates and increased tissue 
      lignin concentrations reported for some Bt corn hybrids have been highlighted 
      recently as they may influence soil carbon dynamics. We assessed the effects of 
      MON863 Bt corn, producing the Cry3Bb protein against the corn rootworm complex, on 
      these aspects and associated decomposer communities by terminal restriction fragment 
      length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. Litterbags containing cobs, roots, or stalks 
      plus leaves from Bt and unmodified corn with (non-Bt+I) or without (non-Bt) 
      insecticide applied were placed on the soil surface and at a 10-cm depth in field 
      plots planted with these crop treatments. The litterbags were recovered and analyzed 
      after 3.5, 15.5, and 25 months. No significant effect of treatment (Bt, non-Bt, and 
      non-Bt+I) was observed on initial tissue lignin concentrations, litter decomposition 
      rate, or bacterial decomposer communities. The effect of treatment on fungal 
      decomposer communities was minor, with only 1 of 16 comparisons yielding separation 
      by treatment. Environmental factors (litterbag recovery year, litterbag placement, 
      and plot history) led to significant differences for most measured variables. 
      Combined, these results indicate that the differences detected were driven primarily 
      by environmental factors rather than by any differences between the corn hybrids or 
      the use of tefluthrin. We conclude that the Cry3Bb corn tested in this study is 
      unlikely to affect carbon residence time or turnover in soils receiving these crop 
      residues.

TI  - Isolation and identification of cellulolytic bacteria involved in the degradation of 
      natural cellulosic fibres.
PG  - 292-9
AB  - In search for bacterial cultures that are able to rapidly degrade cellulosic plant 
      fibres in vitro, 77 cellulolytic strains were isolated from Belgian and Czech soils 
      after enrichment on flax or sisal fibres as sole sources of carbon. The strains were 
      characterized using fatty acid analysis, and 74 strains were grouped into three 
      major clusters by numerical analysis. The first major cluster contained Cellulomonas 
      strains. Within this cluster three subclusters could be delineated by principal 
      component analysis, that were recognized by their fatty acid compositions as 
      Cellulomonas gelida, Cellulomonas biazotea and Cellulomonas cellulans, containing 9, 
      8 and 13 strains respectively. The second major cluster, with 9 strains, was 
      assigned to Flavobacterium johnsoniae. The 34 strains of the third cluster could not 
      be identified by commercial identification systems on the basis of their fatty acid 
      profiles and API 20NE profiles. On the basis of their phenotypic characteristics 
      they met the description of the genus Cellvibrio, their fatty acid profiles were 
      similar to those of four authentic Cellvibrio mixtus strains, and the 16S rRNA genes 
      from four representatives showed up to 97.8% sequence similarity to 16S rDNA from 
      Cellvibrio mixtus ACM 2603. Three non-clustered strains were assigned to 
      Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Achromobacter piechaudii and Pseudomonas mendocina. 
      Two strains assigned to Cellvibrio were able to degrade several flax, broom and 
      cotton fibres very rapidly in a standardized in vitro test, causing mass losses of 
      40 to 86% within 13 days of incubation, but not jute.

TI  - Bioconversion of corn straw by coupling ensiling and solid-state fermentation.
PG  - 277-80
AB  - A two-stage process that combined solid-state fermentation (SSF) and ensiling was 
      used for bioconversion of corn straw, in order to increase nutritional value and 
      palatability for animal feed. SSF of corn straw increased the level of protein from 
      6.7% to 14.7% and decreased the cellulose by 38.0% and hemicellulose by 21.2%. 
      Cellulase and xylanase were produced during SSF. After SSF, the fermented substrate 
      was directly ensiled by inoculating with lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In situ 
      produced enzymes and bacterial inoculation resulted in a rapid drop in pH, a high 
      level of lactic acid production, partial degradation of cell wall components and 
      generation of reducing sugars (RSs). Efficiency of ensiling at 25 degrees C, 30 
      degrees C, 35 degrees C, 40 degrees C was evaluated. Temperature influenced the 
      effect of ensiling; the higher the temperature, the shorter the ensiling period. The 
      combined fermentation upgraded the nutritional value, enhanced the efficiency of 
      ensiling and reduced bioprocessing costs.

TI  - [Isolation, identification and phylogenetic analysis of a thermophilic cellulolytic 
      anaerobic bacterium].
PG  - 138-44
AB  - Four strains of thermophilic cellulolytic anaeobic bacteria were isolated from fresh 
      feces, heat compost, cellulolytic mixed culture with a method based on adherence of 
      cellulolytic bacteria to cellulose. The cells of isolates were straight or slightly 
      curved rods that were 0.4 micron-0.6 micron x 3 microns-15 microns, Gram negative, 
      strictly anaerobic, sulfate reduction negative, spore-forming bacteria. Most of the 
      cells had oval terminal spores, while subterminal spores, middle spores, two or more 
      spores also could be observed and spore formation could occurred in any position. 
      The isolates degraded cellulose filter paper, cellulose powder Whatman CF II, 
      microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose powder MN300 and unpretreated maize stem core, 
      sugarcane residue and rice straw. The pH and temperature ranges for growth on 
      cellulose were 6.2-8.9 and 45 degrees C-65 degrees C respectively with the optima, 
      7.0-7.5 and 55 degrees C-60 degrees C, respectively. The major fermentation products 
      from cellulose were acetic acid, ethanol, CO2, H2. The isolates could ferment 
      cellobiose, glucose, fructose, maltose, and sorbital. The phylogenetic analysis 
      based on 16S rDNA suggested strain EVA1 was the closest relative of Clostridium 
      thermocellum with 99.8% sequence similarity.

TI  - Abundance of polymers degrading microorganisms in a sea-based solid waste disposal 
      site.
PG  - 177-86
AB  - In order to assess the degradability of plastics in solid waste disposal landfill 
      sites, microbial populations capable of degrading five kinds of plastic-constituting 
      polymers, poly epsilon-caprolactone (PCL), polylactic acid (PLA), polyethylene 
      glycol (PEG), poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and cellulose acetate (CA), in a 
      sea-based solid waste disposal site were investigated. Enumeration of aerobic and 
      anaerobic polymers-degrading microorganisms (PDMs) was performed against to total 8 
      leachate samples, which were seasonally collected from the facultative pretreatment 
      pond and the aerated lagoon. Both aerobic and anaerobic PDMs for natural polymers, 
      PHB and CA, were found in all of the samples, while those for chemically-synthesized 
      polymers, PCL, PLA and PEG, could not be always detected. In most cases, the ratios 
      of the PHB- and CA-degraders to the heterotrophic bacterial population were more 
      than 0.1%. On the other hand, the ratios of PCL-, PLA- and PEG-degraders were often 
      much lower. These data indicate that the plastics degradation potential is commonly 
      present in the studied disposal site, and that the degradation potential for 
      plastics composed of chemically-synthesized polymers is inferior to that of natural 
      polymers. Population sizes of the PDMs correlated to those of heterotrophic 
      bacteria, and the counts of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and PDMs in the aerated 
      lagoon tended to be higher than those of anaerobic ones, indicating that the 
      aeration of the leachate resulted in the activation of growth of whole aerobic 
      microbial community including the PDMs.

TI  - Competition strategies for the decolorization of a textile-reactive dye with the 
      white-rot fungi Trametes versicolor under non-sterile conditions.
PG  - 736-44
AB  - A variety of white-rot fungi can oxidize textile dyes under sterile conditions; 
      however, an important consideration for their use in treating wastewater containing 
      textile dyes is whether similar degrees of treatment can be achieved under 
      non-sterile conditions. Four strategies were investigated for their potential in 
      optimizing the use of the fungus Trametes versicolor in non-sterile culture for 
      treating wastewater containing the diazo textile dye C.I. Reactive Black 5 (RB5). 
      Three strategies with suspended culture were designed to increase the decolorization 
      activity in suspended culture from a given amount of T. versicolor inoculum based on 
      its tolerance of low pH (pH reduction in medium), production of extracellular 
      enzymes (use of suspended enzymes alone), and its ability to produce enzymes 
      independent of growth (nitrogen limitation in medium). The results showed that 
      reduction of the medium pH to 3 did not suppress bacterial growth, while enzyme 
      production by T. versicolor ceased. The use of the extracellular enzymes alone would 
      allow the decoupling of the process of fungal growth from wastewater treatment; 
      however, the enzyme activity of an enzyme suspension decreased rapidly under 
      non-sterile conditions. The strategy of limiting nitrogen in the medium to suppress 
      bacterial growth has potential together with the fourth strategy, the cultivation of 
      fungi on organic solids to produce inocula for a decolorization process under 
      non-sterile conditions. A high degree of decolorization of RB5 under non-sterile 
      conditions was achieved with T. versicolor grown on grains as sole substrate. The 
      rate of decolorization was dependent on the amount of fungal inoculum used.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of alkalotolerant bacteria and optimization of 
      process parameters for decolorization and detoxification of pulp and paper mill 
      effluent by Taguchi approach.
PG  - 967-78
LID - 10.1007/s10532-010-9356-x [doi]
AB  - Four different bacterial strains were isolated from pulp and paper mill sludge in 
      which one alkalotolerant isolate (LP1) having higher capability to remove color and 
      lignin, was identified as Bacillus sp. by 16S RNA sequencing. Optimization of 
      process parameters for decolorization was initially performed to select growth 
      factors which were further substantiated by Taguchi approach in which seven factors, 
      % carbon, % black liquor, duration, pH, temperature, stirring and inoculum size, at 
      two levels, applying L-8 orthogonal array were taken. Maximum color was removed at 
      pH 8, temperature 35°C, stirring 200 rpm, sucrose (2.5%), 48 h, 5% (w/v) inoculum 
      size and 10% black liquor. After optimization 2-fold increase in color and lignin 
      removal from 25-69% and 28-53%, respectively, indicated significance of Taguchi 
      approach in decolorization and delignification of lignin in pulp and paper mill 
      effluent. Enzymes involved in the process of decolorization of effluent were found 
      to be xylanase (54 U/ml) and manganese peroxidase (28 U/ml). Treated effluent was 
      also evaluated for toxicity by Comet assay using Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC 36 as 
      model organism, which indicated 58% reduction after treatment by bacterium.

TI  - Swine manure composition affects the biochemical origins, composition, and 
      accumulation of odorous compounds.
PG  - 2131-8
AB  - Odors from swine production facilities are associated with the storage and 
      decomposition of manure. Diet is linked to manure composition and will likely affect 
      odor, but the microbial mechanisms responsible for manure decomposition and odor 
      production are poorly understood. To identify the sources of odor during manure 
      fermentation, substrates (starch, casein, and cellulose) were added to slurries of 
      fresh swine manure, and the anaerobic accumulation of fermentation products and the 
      consumption of substrates were measured relative to no addition of substrates. 
      Volatile fatty acids and alcohols were the dominant fermentation products in all 
      treatments. The total VFA concentration from starch treatment was greater (P < 
      0.001) than for all other treatments. Branched-chain VFA and aromatic compounds 
      accumulated in all treatments, but accumulation in the casein treatments was greater 
      (P < 0.001) than in all other treatments. Thus, addition of carbohydrate to swine 
      manure slurries did not circumvent protein fermentation, as was previously observed 
      in cattle manure slurries. Based on substrate loss, starch and protein fermentation 
      were equivalent in all treatments, with losses of each exceeding 4% of the DM. 
      Substrate additions had a limited effect on the overall accumulation of odor 
      compounds in manure and on odor compound composition. Compared with the results of 
      the earlier fermentation study of fresh cattle manure, swine manure fermentation 
      produced less lactate and more products of protein fermentation (branched-chain VFA 
      and aromatic ring compounds). We hypothesize that differences in manure organic 
      matter composition between cattle and swine, a result of diet and digestion, select 
      for bacterial communities that are adapted to the available substrate composition.

TI  - Desulfitobacterium aromaticivorans sp. nov. and Geobacter toluenoxydans sp. nov., 
      iron-reducing bacteria capable of anaerobic degradation of monoaromatic 
      hydrocarbons.
PG  - 686-695
LID - 10.1099/ijs.0.003525-0 [doi]
AB  - Dissimilatory iron reduction plays a significant role in subsurface environments. 
      Currently, it is assumed that members of the genus Geobacter constitute the majority 
      of the iron-reducing micro-organisms that oxidize aromatic compounds in contaminated 
      subsurface environments. Here, we report the isolation of two phylogenetically 
      distinct pure cultures of iron-reducing degraders of monoaromatic hydrocarbons, 
      strain TMJ1(T), which belongs to the genus Geobacter within the Deltaproteobacteria, 
      and strain UKTL(T), belonging to the genus Desulfitobacterium within the Clostridia. 
      Both strains utilize a wide range of substrates as carbon and energy sources, 
      including the aromatic compounds toluene, phenol and p-cresol. Additionally, strain 
      UKTL(T) utilizes o-xylene and TMJ1(T) utilizes m-cresol. Anaerobic degradation of 
      toluene in both strains and o-xylene in strain UKTL(T) is initiated by activation 
      with fumarate addition to the methyl group. The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains 
      TMJ1(T) and UKTL(T) are 54.4 and 47.7 mol%, respectively. Based on a detailed 
      physiological characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of 
      both strains, we propose the names Desulfitobacterium aromaticivorans sp. nov. (type 
      strain UKTL(T) =DSM 19510(T) =JCM 15765(T)) and Geobacter toluenoxydans sp. nov. 
      (type strain TMJ1(T) =DSM 19350(T) =JCM 15764(T)) to accommodate these strains. To 
      the best of our knowledge, strain UKTL(T) is the first described spore-forming, 
      iron-reducing bacterium that can degrade aromatic hydrocarbons.

TI  - Microbial degradation of cellulose wastes in continuous bioreactors.
PG  - 195-8
AB  - This paper reports on experiments concerning the biodegradation of cellulose wastes 
      from wine-producing industries, as well as from cereal crops processing in 
      agricultural farms, using cellulolytic bacterial and fungal species immobilized on 
      radiopolymerized hydrogels. There are described three types of such bioreactors and 
      their main features. The immobilization procedures have been achieved using the 
      following species of microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis and B. licheniformis, from 
      bacteria, as well as Pleurotus ostreatus and Trichoderma viride, from filamentous 
      fungi. The immobilization matrices were prepared by radiopolymerization, using a 
      60Co radioactive source, designed for gamma irradiation. A consistent increasing of 
      dry weight loss correlated with a correspondent enhancement of biodegradation rate 
      by 10 - 20%, have revealed significant differences of metabolic activities between 
      these immobilized bacteria and fungi on radiopolymerized hydrogels and those free 
      cells cultures of the same microorganisms, which were grown on agar-agar gels and 
      used as control references, in all performed experiments. Regarding the enzymatic 
      activity of immobilized microorganisms the registered results have revealed an 
      increasing of total reducing sugars with 20 - 30 mg g(-1). The enhancement of 
      cellulolytic activity was higher with 0.1 - 0.3 U min(-1), in comparison with those 
      values determined for the same process performed by the same microorganisms, used as 
      control.

TI  - Thatch biodegradation and antifungal activities of two lignocellulolytic 
      Streptomyces strains in laboratory cultures and in golf green turfgrass.
PG  - 550-8
AB  - The use of lignocellulolytic Streptomyces spp. as biological agents, to enhance 
      thatch degradation in turf and to slow its rate of accumulation while controlling 
      fungal growth in the thatch layer, was studied. In flask scale studies, two 
      lignocellulolytic Streptomyces violaceusniger (= hygroscopicus) strains (YCED9 and 
      WYE53) decomposed thatch (> 30% dry weight) over a 12-week incubation period. 
      Biodegradation was accompanied by production of extracellular cellulases, xylanases, 
      and peroxidases. The accumulation of the polymeric, water-soluble lignin degradation 
      intermediate acid, precipitable polymeric lignin (APPL), was also observed. Residual 
      thatch from 12-week-old cultures had an increased lignin-to-carbohydrate ratio, an 
      indication that although lignin was metabolized, carbohydrates were preferential 
      carbon sources for these actinomycetes. A spore-containing soluble dry powder 
      formulation was used as an inoculum in an in situ field experiment. This formulation 
      was maintained in storage at 4 degrees C for over two years without viability loss. 
      Results from the golf green experiment showed that although treated thatch layers in 
      established greens were not appreciably reduced over the course of one summer, the 
      Streptomyces were active and maintained their populations within the thatch, while 
      fungal growth was suppressed as compared to controls. The results show that 
      treatment of turfgrass with these Streptomyces may be useful for the long-term 
      control of fungal populations within the thatch. Longer field studies are required 
      to assess the long-term potential for also controlling thatch build-up and fungal 
      pathogens.

PG  - 253-8
AB  - The biodiversity of a mesophilic microbial community BYND-8 capable of degrading 
      lignocellulose at 30 degrees C was detected using denaturing gradient gel 
      electrophoresis (DGGE) and the isolation of pure cultures, and the effect of the 
      liquid of rice straw degradation by BYND-8 on biogas production was measured. Six 
      bacterial strains were isolated using peptone cellulose solution medium, and the 
      highest similarities of their 16S rDNA gene sequences to Serratia sp. PSGB 13, S. 
      marcescens strain UFLA-25LS, S. marcescens strain DAP33, Alcaligenes sp. YcX-20, 
      Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain C6, Bacillus cereus isolate BRL02-71 were 99%, 
      100%, 96%, 100%, 100% and 99%, respectively. In addition, one band was detected 
      besides six bands of cultured isolates on the DGGE gel, and it showed 100% sequence 
      similarity to uncultured bacterium clone ATB-KS-1446. The cumulative biogas and 
      methane productions of biogas fermentation system added with the liquid of rice 
      straw degraded by BYND-8 were 13 167 mL and 7 248 mL, 44.5% and 95.3% higher than 
      those of the control, respectively, in the early 15 days of fermentation. The 
      results showed that the biodiversity of microbial community BYND-8 was very high, 
      and the time of producing biogas was put forward and biogas production was increased 
      with application of microbial community for rice straw pretreatment during the 
      biogas fermentation.

TI  - 14C-[lignin]-lignocellulose biodegradation by bacteria isolated from polluted soil.
PG  - 584-9
AB  - Four bacterial species [Branhamella catarrhalis (gram -ve), Brochothrix species 
      (gram -ve), Micrococcus luteus (gram +ve) and Bacillus firmus (gram +ve)], isolated 
      from the soil polluted with cane sugar factory effluents, were found capable of 
      growing on solid media supplemented with indulin AT (a polymeric industrial lignin) 
      as sole C source. All the four species could metabolize cinnamic acid (a 
      non-hydroxylated phenylpropanoid) as sole carbon source with significant suppression 
      on addition of readily metabolizable carbon source (glucose). However, Br. 
      catarrhalis and Brochothrix sp. were capable of metabolizing ferulic acid, but could 
      not do so on addition of glucose. Of the four species, Br. catarrhalis could evolve 
      significant amount of 14CO2 from U-14C (lignin)-lignocellulose prepared from rice 
      stalks (ca. 10% of the added radioactivity in 3 weeks), in addition to 
      solubilization of another 11.7% radioactivity in culture filtrate. The other three 
      species could not significantly evolve 14CO2, though a significant fraction of added 
      14C-lignin (6.1 to 11.2%) could be solubilized into culture filtrate, suggesting 
      lack of ring-cleavage or other CO2 evolving mechanisms in these species.

TI  - Treatment of benzene-contaminated airstreams in laboratory-scale biofilters packed 
      with raw and sieved sugarcane bagasse and with peat.
PG  - 87-96
AB  - Three identical upflow laboratory-scale biofilters, inoculated with the 
      benzene-degrading strain Pseudomonas sp. NCIMB 9688 but filled up with different 
      packing media (PM), specifically raw sugarcane bagasse, sieved sugarcane bagasse and 
      peat, were employed to eliminate benzene from waste air. Biofilters performances 
      were evaluated by continuous runs in parallel at different influent benzene 
      concentrations, sequentially stepped up through three different superficial gas 
      velocities (31, 61, and 122 m h(-1)). The peat-packed biofilter exhibited the best 
      performances over the whole experimentation, ensuring removal efficiency of 100% for 
      influent benzene concentrations < or = 0.05 g m(-3), regardless of the superficial 
      gas velocity, and up to 0.4 g m(-3) at 31 m h(-1). Maximum elimination capacities of 
      biofilters packed with raw and sieved sugarcane bagasse and with peat were 3.2, 6.4 
      and 26 g mPM(-3) h(-1) at 6.1, 12 and 31 g mPM(-3) h(-1) loading rates, resulting in 
      52, 53 and 84% removals, respectively. The bacterial concentration distribution 
      along the medium was shown to depend on the benzene loading rate and a correlation 
      between specific benzene elimination rate and biomass concentration was established 
      for biofilters packed with sieved sugarcane bagasse and peat. The macrokinetics of 
      the process were also studied using the profiles of benzene and biomass 
      concentrations, collected under different conditions over the height of both 
      biofilters, and a zeroth-order kinetic model was shown to describe successfully the 
      degradation process.

TI  - Effects of intermittent addition of cellulase for production of L-lactic acid from 
      wastewater sludge by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation.
PG  - 263-70
AB  - An attempt was made to create L-lactic acid, a precursor of poly-lactic acid, which 
      is a biodegradable plastic, from wastewater sludge from the paper-manufacturing 
      industry. The sludge contained a high percentage of cellulose and needed to be 
      hydrolyzed to glucose by the action of the cellulase before being treating with 
      lactic acid bacteria. Therefore, a method involving simultaneous saccharification 
      and fermentation (SSF) was carried out. The optimum pH of the SSF for production of 
      the lactic acid by the newly isolated lactic acid bacterium with a high selectively 
      of L-lactic acid was found out to be around pH = 5.0, and the optimum temperature to 
      be approximately 40 degrees C. On the basis of the measurement of the cell density 
      changes in the lactic acid bacteria, it was ascertained that the bacterial activity 
      could continue at a high level for a relatively long period of time, and that the 
      L-lactic acid productivity was diminished by the rapid deactivation of the 
      cellulase. With the intermittent addition of cellulase once daily for the sake of 
      compensating for the cellulase deactivation, the L-lactic acid attained a maximum 
      concentration of 16.9 g/L, i.e., a 72.2% yield based on the potential glucose 
      contained in the sludge under optimum pH and temperature conditions.

      (presscakes or pulp) under hypoxic conditions was accompanied by cellulose 
      depolymerization, protein hydrolysis, and degradation of other plant components, 
      including some processes of mixed-type carbohydrate fermentation. The bacterial 
      fermentation yielded propionic, butyric, and hexanoic acids and butyric acid 
      derivatives. The bacterial metabolism and fermentation degree can be characterized 
      by the proportions of fatty acids in the reaction mixture. The product of sea

LID - 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.06.011 [doi]
AB  - The influence of a defined trace metal solution and additionally Ni(2+) on anaerobic 
      digestion of biomass was investigated. A novel synthetic model substrate was 
      designed consisting of cellulose, starch and urea as carbon and nitrogen source in a 
      ratio mimicking the basic composition of maize silage. Two independent batch 
      fermentations were carried out over 21 d with the synthetic model substrate in the 
      presence of the trace metal solution. Particularly an increase in nickel 
      concentrations (17 and 34 microM) enhanced methane formation by up to 20%. This 
      increased activity was also corroborated by fluorescence microscopy measurements 
      based on cofactor F(420). The eubacterial and methanogenic population was 
      characterized with the single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and the 
      amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified by different 
      primer systems. Nearly the half of the analyzed bacteria were identified as 
      Firmicutes while 70% in this phylum belonged to the class of Clostridiales and 30% 
      to the class of Bacilli. Bacteroides and uncultured bacteria represented each a 
      quarter of the analyzed community. Methanogenic archaea were investigated with 
      ARDRA, too. The hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus sp. was the dominant genus which is 
      commonly described for maize digestion thus confirming the value of the model 
      substrate.

TI  - Development of a methanogenic process to degrade exhaustively the organic fraction 
      of municipal "grey waste" under thermophilic and hyperthermophilic conditions.
PG  - 83-91
AB  - Different laboratory-scale, continuously driven reactor concepts (up to 3 reactors 
      in series, max. 70 degrees C) for anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of 
      municipal grey waste were investigated. Over a period of 2 1/2 years several setups 
      of reactors being daily fed and held in steady state balance were investigated. The 
      perferred variant was a 2-stage setup with a HRT of 4.3 d for the 1st and 14.2 d for 
      the 2nd reactor. Removal efficiencies of VS obtained by comparing the organic 
      loading rate (OLR, g VS/l/d) of the effluent with the OLR of the feed could reach 
      80%. Removal efficiencies determined indirectly by the combined biogas yield of the 
      1st and 2nd reactor stage revealed even up to 91.5% of the theoretical possible 
      yield of 807 l/kg VS. The produced gas had a methane content of 60-65%. A completely 
      distinct hydrolysis stage with a gas production of only 1.6-5.5% of the theoretical 
      yield could be reached by hyperthermophilic conditions (60-70 degrees C) or by a HRT 
      of 1.25 d. It also demonstrated that a stable methanogenesis was not possible at 
      temperatures of 60-70 degrees C. Kinetic analyses of the 2nd reactor stage revealed 
      that the degradation of VS fell from 80 to 40% with raising organic loading rate 
      (OLR) from 3 to 11 g VS/l/d. In contrast to this the VS-removal of the first 
      hydrolysis reactor stage increased linearily from 5 to 20% at raising OLR's from 12 
      to 26 g VS/l/d. The same kinetics with linear increase exhibited the specific 
      cellulose degradation with conversion rates of 0.1-3 x 109 g cellulose/single 
      bacterium (10(-12) g)/d. This was an indication for the cellulose degradation as a 
      rate limiting step. Both reactor stages combined allowed an optimal VS removal 
      efficiency at OLR of 10 g VS/l/d. Analysis of bacterial populations of 28 reactors 
      were referred either to eubacteria utilizing different sugars or cellulose or 
      acetate or H2-CO2 or archaea (plus antibiotics) with acetate or H2-CO2 as substrate. 
      H2-CO2 utilizers with numbers of 10(8)-10(10)/g TS dominated obviously the 
      acetotrophic methanogens by the factor 10-10,000. This explained the observed short 
      HRTs being possible.

TI  - Bleaching of bagasse pulp with enzyme pre-treatment.
PG  - 163-8
AB  - The effluent from pulp bleaching processes containing chlorinated lignin and 
      degraded polyphenolic intermediates remains as a major source of water pollution 
      from the pulp and paper industries. Alternative elemental chlorine free bleaching 
      methods based on the usage of chlorine dioxide, ozone and hydrogen peroxide are 
      potential substitutes. Bio-bleaching methods, which involve pre-treatment of pulp 
      with microbial enzymes such as xylanases, have emerged as viable options. 
      Investigations reported in this paper aim at exploring the suitability of commercial 
      bacterial xylanase enzyme preparations for bio-bleaching of bagasse pulps in 
      conjunction with specific chemical bleach sequences employing hydrogen peroxide (P), 
      alkali extraction (E), ozonation (Z), hypochlorite (H) and chelation (Q) stages. The 
      effluent profiles and pulp qualities obtained for each of the bleach combinations 
      (involving bio-bleaching and chemical bleaching sequences) were monitored. Analysis 
      of the results clearly indicates that the inclusion of enzyme pre-treatment with the 
      TCF (total chlorine free) and ECF (elemental chlorine free) sequences has a 
      significant effect on the effluent (COD, lignin and colour) and pulp quality (kappa 
      number, brightness) parameters. In conclusion, the findings of this investigation 
      indicate the potential promise of enzyme pre-treatment in combination with chemical 
      bleaching to enhance the quality of pulps and combined effluents.

TI  - Enzymatic dehalogenation of pentachlorophenol by Pseudomonas fluorescens of the 
      microbial community from tannery effluent.
PG  - 65-70
AB  - Four different bacterial isolates obtained from a stable bacterial consortium were 
      capable of utilizing pentachlorophenol (PCP) as sole carbon and energy source. The 
      consortium was developed by continuous enrichment in the chemostat. The degradation 
      of PCP by bacterial strain was preceded through an oxidative route as indicated by 
      accumulation of tetrachloro-rho-hydroquinone and dichlorohydroquinone as determined 
      by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Among the four isolates, 
      Pseudomonas fluorescens exhibited maximum degradation capability and enzyme 
      production. PCP-monooxygenase enzyme was extracted from culture extract and 
      fractionated by DEAE-cellulose ion exchange chromatography. The molecular weight of 
      the enzyme, purified from Pseudomonas fluorescens, determined by sodium dodecyl 
      sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gel filtration 
      chromatography was found to be 24000 Da.

TI  - Organic matter transformation in the environment investigated by quantitative 
      electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy: studies on lignins.
PG  - 1387-94
AB  - The lignins separated from angiosperm and gymnosperm trees, peat and xylitic brown 
      coal were investigated by quantitative EPR. Observed free radicals in lignins are 
      sensitive to alkaline environment. Gaseous ammonia interacting with solid lignins in 
      resonance cavity shifts quinone-hydroquinone equilibria towards formation of 
      semiquinone anions. Complexation of copper(II) by lignins causes drastic decrease of 
      the semiquinones in the matrices. Formation of lignin-Pb(II) complexes yielded 
      radicals characterised by unusually low g-value (1.9999-2.0003). Monomeric 
      structural units of the investigated lignins were recognised by pyrolysis with in 
      situ methylation by tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Although for the natural lignins 
      the mixture of normal semiquinone signals at g about 2.0034 and signals at g 1.9999 
      were observed, some monomeric components of lignins (e.g., caffeic acid, pyrogallol) 
      gave pure lines at g = 1.9999. The bacterial oxidative biodegradation of lignin 
      monomeric components and their Pb(II) complexes resulted in increase of the radical 
      signals.

TI  - [Degradation of anthraquinone blue by Trametes trogii].
PG  - 223-8
AB  - The ability of the white rot fungus Trametes trogii BAFC 463 (high producer of 
      ligninolytic enzymes, especially laccase and manganese peroxidase) to degrade the 
      dye anthraquinone blue, refractory to bacterial attack, was evaluated. Both tropho- 
      and idiophasic T. trogii cultures in synthetic medium (glucose/asparagine) and 
      complex medium (malt extract/glucose) were able to transform up to 88% dye in 4 
      hours. The activity of laccase, an oxygen-dependent phenoloxidase which was present 
      at high levels in all the conditions assayed, might be related to the ability of the 
      fungus to degrade the colorant. This is supported by the fact that in bioreactor 
      experiences carried out at pH 4.5 the addition of anthraquinone blue caused a 
      decrease in the levels of soluble oxygen. However, although high levels of laccase 
      were produced at pH 7.5, the enzyme was not active, and neither dye transformation 
      nor loss in the levels of soluble oxygen were quantified.

TI  - Degradation of paper mill water components in laboratory tests with pure cultures of 
      bacteria.
PG  - 141-8
AB  - The degradation of dissolved and colloidal substances from thermomechanical pulp 
      (TMP) by bacteria isolated from a paper mill was studied in a laboratory slide 
      culture system. Burkholderia cepacia strains hydrolysed triglycerides to free fatty 
      acids, and the liberated unsaturated fatty acids were then degraded to some extent. 
      Saturated fatty acids were not notably degraded. However, the branched 
      anteiso-heptadecanoic fatty acid was degraded almost like the unsaturated fatty 
      acids. About 30% of the steryl esters were degraded during 11 days, increasing the 
      concentrations of free sterols. Approximately 25% of the dehydroabietic, and 45% of 
      the abietic and isopimaric resin acids were degraded during 11 days. The degree of 
      unsaturation seemed to be of greater importance for the degradation of fatty acids 
      than the molar mass. No degradation of dissolved hemicelluloses could be observed 
      with any of the nine bacterial strains studied. Burkholderia cepacia strains and one 
      Bacillus coagulans strain degraded monomeric fructose and glucose in winter TMP 
      water, but in summer TMP water, with much lower sugar concentrations, also other 
      Bacillus strains degraded monomeric sugars.

TI  - Kinetics and toxicity of direct reaction between ozone and 1,2-dihydrobenzene in 
      dilute aqueous solution.
PG  - 321-6
AB  - The presence of toxic aromatic organic compounds in industrial wastewater affects 
      the efficiency of conventional biological treatment. The oxidizing power of ozone 
      represents an interesting pretreatment to reduce toxicity and increase 
      biodegradability. At low pH, ozone is known to attack electron-rich structures by 
      direct electrophilic reactions which open aromatic rings, and generate smaller 
      oxidized compounds. This paper reports experimental results on kinetic and toxicity 
      aspects of ozone direct reactions with 1,2-dihydrobenzene. This toxic compound is 
      frequently found in cellulose bleaching effluents. Although the reaction pathway is 
      rather complex, 4-carbon compounds, such as maleic acid, are readily formed during 
      the first stage of ozonation. These 4-carbon compounds are further oxidized to form 
      smaller molecules (mostly 2-carbon, such as oxalic acid). The apparent kinetics of 
      1,2-dihydrobenzene follows a second order law, with a rate constant around 0.36 (dm3 
      mmol-1s-1), at pH 2 and 20 degrees C. Results show that the BOD:COD ratio increase 
      five-fold as ozonation progresses. Furthermore, the mutagenicity of 
      1,2-dihydrobenzene totally disappears as the aromatic compound is destroyed by 
      ozonation.
